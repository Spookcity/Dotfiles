		<name>Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures</name>
		<desc>After an introductory sequence in which Pac-Man introduces himself and the game's mechanics, the plot unfolds as a loosely connected series of misadventures stemming from Pac-Man's quest to complete tasks for his family, all while the ghosts and their mysterious leader plot to destroy him. Pac-Man is first tasked with finding milk for Pac-Baby, which he procures from the local farm. Some time after, Pac-Man is asked by Ms. Pac-Man to pick a special flower for Lucy, a friend of Pac-Jr's for her birthday. Pac-Man is given a trolley ticket which he uses to venture into the nearby mountains, hang-gliding and dodging ghosts and boulders as he searches for the flower. Upon returning home with the flower, Pac-Man is exasperated to find that Lucy's party has already started, and that she has already been given another flower. Some time after, Pac-Jr comes home crying, and tells his dad that his guitar was stolen by ghosts while he was in Pac-City. Pac-Man is given a train ticket to travel to the city, where he meets a man selling balloons, and takes on a disgruntled security guard to get the guitar back. In the final segment of the game, Pac-Man discovers from a news report that the ghosts are stealing ABC gum from children all over Pac-City, at which point the Ghost Witch of Netor takes over the broadcast and challenges Pac-Man to face her and her newly created Gum Monster. He sets off to work his way through the abandoned factory where the monster is being created. The game culminates in a final battle between Super Pac-Man and the Gum Monster. After the Gum Monster's defeat, the Ghost Witch and her minions flee, and Pac-Man is congratulated by the town and his family as a hero, except that he didn't save their ABC gum.</desc>

Game modes include exhibition, tour and tournament for both singles and doubles.

Along the usual offering of lobs, volleys, passing shots, top spins and slashes, the player can leave player movement to the console, and just focus on hitting the ball with the right shot with the correct timing (the player can also set the playing style, from all-court, baseline, or rush net). For those needing a boost of confidence before entering competitive play, Vic Braden, one of the most well known tennis coaches, has a court with special lines, a ball machine and some hints to help them improve their play.</desc>

		<desc>This is one of the games based on the Dick Tracy movie. You are Dick Tracy, a police detective who enjoys a peaceful life with his wife. But his wife's father is murdered by a local gangster named Big Boy Caprice, and Dick Tracy is now out for revenge. The game doesn't follow the exact plot of the movie, but simply lets Dick Tracy fight his way through several levels until he faces his archenemy.

This is a platform shooter/"beat-'em-up" game. Plenty of gunmen will attack our hero from all the sides. Dick can only move to the right or to the left. He can use his pistol gun to take out enemies who are in front or behind him. Since he can't approach enemies who attack from the depth of the screen, he can dispose of them using his machine gun. When the enemy is too close, Dick will punch him instead of shooting.</desc>

		<desc>R.B.I. Baseball '94 refines the engine used in 1993's game by doubling the speed of play, updating player movement with rotoscoped animation, and adding new music and sound effects, including the voice of award-winning broadcaster Jack Buck. You can also play a full 162-game season complete with playoffs and world championships, although a password is required to continue progress. Eight hundred actual players (with stats based on the 1993 season) have been added with colorful portraits appearing whenever they step up to the plate. Despite the game not having a Major League Baseball license, all 28 teams from 1993 are represented by city name and ballparks have been modeled after authentic stadiums. Also featured are the rosters for every division winner since 1985 as well as the 1989-93 All-Star squads. Game modes include: Home Run Derby, Game Breakers, Practice, Single Game, Season and Create Teams.</desc>

		<name>Another World</name>
		<desc>Another World is a platform game, where the player uses the keyboard or gamepad to make the protagonist Lester run, jump, attack or perform other actions. In the initial part of the game, Lester is weaponless, able to kick at small creatures but otherwise vulnerable. After escaping with his alien ally, Lester acquires a laser pistol from a fallen foe. The pistol has three capabilities: a standard fire mode, the abilities to create force fields to block enemy fire, and a powerful charged shot that can break through force fields and some walls. Later, Lester also gains a plasma ball that can be used like a grenade to defeat foes. Enemies will also have the same capabilities, requiring the player to take advantage of the three gun modes and the environment to overcome hostile forces and escape.
 
Lester and his alien ally cannot sustain any damage, and the game will be over if either takes a hit. However, the game uses numerous checkpoints, and the player can restart at the last point indefinitely. On older consoles without the ability to save a game, the player can write down an alphanumeric code for these checkpoints and re-enter it when restarting the game later.</desc>

		<name>Hard Drivin'</name>
		<desc>Hard Drivin '​ is a driving arcade game that invites players to test drive a high-powered sports car on stunt and speed courses. The game featured one of the first 3D polygon driving environments[3] via a simulator cabinet, rendered with a custom architecture.[4] The force feedback, car physics simulator, game design and most game programming were done by Max Behensky.[citation needed] According to the in-game credit screen, Hard Drivin' was designed by two teams working concurrently in the United States and Ireland.

Development began in 1988. Atari also originally intended to release the game in 1988. However, according to one of Atari's Engineer and designer, it was delayed due to the dispute from its Vice President claiming that no one would buy an arcade cabinet for $10,000 after The Last Starfighter arcade game was canceled for the same reason a few years ago earlier. After weeks of research, it was decided that $10,000 was an acceptable price point.[5] [6] [7]

Hard Drivin '​ was released in February 1989,[1][3][8] when arcade driving games were largely implemented with scaled 2D sprites, such as Pole Position and OutRun, and when filled-polygon 3D graphics of any kind were rare in games. Hard Drivin '​ is the second commercially released arcade racing game to use 3D polygons, after Winning Run.

In total, there are fifteen variations of the arcade unit. The eleven cockpit and four compact machines included various British, German and Japanese versions.

Hard Drivin' sold 3,318 video game arcade cabinets.[1] The PC games Stunt Driver and Stunts were released after Hard Drivin '​ and shared many elements with it.</desc>

		<desc>Sega even had a third project running, this time for the Mega Drive. Once again, the development was done by a third party. This time it seems to have been the mostly unknown developer called Opus, as in-game art and the sound engine used indicate. This game was never released, probably due to quality issues, but a beta copy was leaked and can be played on emulators nowadays. The game would have tried to build on the concept of the original arcade game, but feels to some degree more like a very bad approach to the Streets of Rage school of beat-em-ups. It is obvious that it either was in a rather early development stage, or Sega did right to pull the plug on this botched mess.

The game features a lot of cut scenes, all of them in the finest Engrish. The chapter titles are in Japanese, though. The story doesn't make any sense, at least not in its presented state. Later in the game, you meet people you should know but don't, and about halfway through the game you get to know that your goal from the beginning was to rescue Ryu's kidnapped lady friend.</desc>

The game came as a two-player cockpit cabinet and featured both cooperative and competitive game play modes.

In the single-player mode, there are 19 computer simulated missions. In the two player mode, two players may work together in the simulation world, or they may choose to go at combat with each other where the mission objective is to destroy the other player.[1]

Steel Talons was ported to the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, Atari Lynx handheld, Atari ST, Atari Falcon and SNES.</desc>

Squirrel King is extremely similar to Capcom's Chip 'N Dale: Rescue Rangers and it sequel, Chip 'N Dale: Rescue Rangers 2 for the NES, to the point where the player actually plays as two characters named "Chip" and "Dale" (though they look slightly different to their Disney counterparts).

The game is a typical isometric-projection baseball game. When batting, the D-pad moves around and A and C swing. When pitching, Left and Right move around and C pitches. Unlike most, if not all, Mega Drive baseball games, however, you can also take control of the rest of the team when the ball has been hit: you control the player with the ball; the D-pad moves around and C throws the ball.</desc>

		<name>Bulls vs Lakers and the NBA Playoffs</name>
		<desc>Bulls vs Lakers and the NBA Playoffs is a basketball video game developed by Electronic Arts and released in 1992 exclusively for the Sega Mega Drive. The game is the sequel to Lakers versus Celtics. The game's name refers to the previous season's NBA championship series, the 1991 NBA Finals matchup between the Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers. It is the second game in the NBA Playoffs series of games.

Although there is no SNES version for Bulls vs Lakers, the SNES (and first) version of Bulls vs. Blazers was heavily based on Bulls vs Lakers, with the later Mega Drive version introducing a few changes from this.

Bulls vs Lakers introduced a television broadcast-style presentation with a fictional television network, "EASN", the Electronic Arts Sports Network. It was the first team basketball game to feature an in-game instant replay feature. Bing Gordon, the Chief Creative Officer of Electronic Arts, was featured as the game announcer. This was also the first game to depict NBA team logos on the courts.

Gameplay[edit]
The game can be played in various ways: players could play against each other, or against the computer. Games against the computer were divided into two modes, "Exhibition" or "Playoffs". Players could pick from one of the 16 teams that competed in the 1991 NBA Playoffs. Rosters featured many top NBA stars of the time, including Michael Jordan. Games could be configured for 2, 5, 8 or 12 minute quarters. New to the series is a star underneath the player to let users easily know which player they are controlling.

Choose from 29 NBA teams and 145 professional stars with ratings based on the 1996-97 season, or create your own players and save them to battery. Customize your athlete's head, uniform, attributes, or name, and then build his ratings by winning games or correctly answering trivia questions. Sixteen different heads allow you to create offbeat characters such as aliens or clowns.

Moves include alley oops, spin moves, double dunks, and team "fire" (players get hot after making three shots in a row). Up to four players can compete simultaneously in venues ranging from a rooftop and jungle arena to a harbor and city court. Enter in codes to unlock hidden characters, power-ups, and other bonuses. The game will also keep track of statistics such as points-per-game average, longest winning streak, most games played, and overall winning percentage.

Names could not be changed, and since the game lacked a battery, it does not store changes done to kits and passwords were used to resume tournaments (example of a password sheet). Rotherham United are included amongst the English clubs despite never playing in the top tier of English football, this is due to the developer, Krisalis Software, being based in Rotherham.

		<desc>Another World is a platform game, where the player uses the keyboard or gamepad to make the protagonist Lester run, jump, attack or perform other actions. In the initial part of the game, Lester is weaponless, able to kick at small creatures but otherwise vulnerable. After escaping with his alien ally, Lester acquires a laser pistol from a fallen foe. The pistol has three capabilities: a standard fire mode, the abilities to create force fields to block enemy fire, and a powerful charged shot that can break through force fields and some walls. Later, Lester also gains a plasma ball that can be used like a grenade to defeat foes. Enemies will also have the same capabilities, requiring the player to take advantage of the three gun modes and the environment to overcome hostile forces and escape.
 
Lester and his alien ally cannot sustain any damage, and the game will be over if either takes a hit. However, the game uses numerous checkpoints, and the player can restart at the last point indefinitely. On older consoles without the ability to save a game, the player can write down an alphanumeric code for these checkpoints and re-enter it when restarting the game later.</desc>

In Air Buster, the player controls a fighter jet also designed for space travel and shoots enemies, collects power-ups, and defeats bosses to advance levels. As a console game, Air Buster had the distinction of being two player simultaneous, which was rare among side scrolling shooters on home consoles at the time; all games in the Thunder Force, Gradius, and R-Type series were only 1 player on the home consoles.</desc>

Similar to Super Mario Kart, the game allows the user to select one of many cartoon-like characters, racing around a circuit, avoiding obstacles and using special items.

Due to various hardware restrictions, gameplay differs among platforms - the Mega Drive version of the game has the player travel along a road in a similar manner to Hang On or OutRun, whereas the Saturn version renders its levels through 3D geometry, allowing the user to see more of the stage. The Japanese Saturn version of the game is called Street Racer Extra (ストリート　レーサー　エクストラ) due to these additions.

The Mega Drive version of the game was not released in Japan or North America, though did make it to Brazil and Europe. Plans for a North American version were put in place (even getting to the stage of having its own box art with ESRB rating), but were cancelled. Likewise the Saturn version of the game was not released in North America.</desc>

		<name>Virtua Fighter 2 VS Tekken 2</name>
		<desc>Virtua Fighter 2 VS Tekken 2 is a pirated game based off Fighters Megamix and Tekken, made for the Mega Drive by an unknown company. Despite the name, this game includes 5 Virtua Fighter 2 characters, 5 Tekken characters and 2 Fighting Vipers characters: Akira, Pai, Wolf, Lion, Shun, Heihachi, Jun, Lee, Paul, Kazuya, Honey and Bahn. The control is poorly designed and the engine is similar to some other games like Tekken 3 Special. The player can only punch and kick, move slowly and jumpkick if the button is pressed at the perfect time. As a result, the game is more difficult than it should be, although in the options the health bars can be modified so that one or both of the players can't take any damage, making it impossible for the opponent to win.</desc>

		<name>Death Duel</name>
		<desc>Taking place in the future year 2140, the nine of the ten Galactic Federations had gained unwarranted control over galaxy flight traffic and territory. This has caused the one remaining Federation to suffer a loss of supplies and space pirate attacks. The dispute can only be settled through a warranted duel with the Federation’s one duelist to fight against the collective nine alien duelists representing the nine Galactic Federations in control of the space traffic ways, otherwise known as The Super 9’s. The player assumes the role of Barrett Jade, a mecha pilot to win back the space ways and duel against the nine other duelists.

Players started the game off with their first duel with a set number of ammunition for their weapons; the player’s robot had a total of three weapons indicated by all three buttons on the controller. Once the player completed the duel, they would go through a type of Bonus Stage that would qualify them for the next duel as well as increase their score and money. Players could then purchase more ammunition or even new weapons for their robot at a local shop. Players had to time their attacks and aim precisely for key locations of their opponents body. Some enemies could regenerate missing parts of their body (including their head) while some enemies depended on particular mechanical parts to evade fire. If the player ran out of ammunition for all their weapons before the duel was over, they would lose a life and restart the duel over (with the same amount of ammunition they started the duel with). If the duel timer ran out before the duel was over, the player would also lose a life and restart the duel.</desc>

The basic gameplay is similar to Gauntlet, but in an open air setting, with bridges across rivers and such in the maps. The visuals are in the 'metallic and blue' style the Bitmaps appeared to favor.

There were 6 characters available in the game, each with different strengths and weaknesses, and different starting prices. In 2-player mode you each chose a character and played co-operatively, but in one-player games you also choose a character for the computer to control, with its Artificial Intelligence allowing it to open doors, pick up power-ups and take on baddies away from the ones occupying your character.</desc>

		<desc>After an introductory sequence in which Pac-Man introduces himself and the game's mechanics, the plot unfolds as a loosely connected series of misadventures stemming from Pac-Man's quest to complete tasks for his family, all while the ghosts and their mysterious leader plot to destroy him. Pac-Man is first tasked with finding milk for Pac-Baby, which he procures from the local farm. Some time after, Pac-Man is asked by Ms. Pac-Man to pick a special flower for Lucy, a friend of Pac-Jr's for her birthday. Pac-Man is given a trolley ticket which he uses to venture into the nearby mountains, hang-gliding and dodging ghosts and boulders as he searches for the flower. Upon returning home with the flower, Pac-Man is exasperated to find that Lucy's party has already started, and that she has already been given another flower. Some time after, Pac-Jr comes home crying, and tells his dad that his guitar was stolen by ghosts while he was in Pac-City. Pac-Man is given a train ticket to travel to the city, where he meets a man selling balloons, and takes on a disgruntled security guard to get the guitar back. In the final segment of the game, Pac-Man discovers from a news report that the ghosts are stealing ABC gum from children all over Pac-City, at which point the Ghost Witch of Netor takes over the broadcast and challenges Pac-Man to face her and her newly created Gum Monster. He sets off to work his way through the abandoned factory where the monster is being created. The game culminates in a final battle between Super Pac-Man and the Gum Monster. After the Gum Monster's defeat, the Ghost Witch and her minions flee, and Pac-Man is congratulated by the town and his family as a hero, except that he didn't save their ABC gum.</desc>

You take on the role of Dastardly and Mutley from the Hanna-Barbera cartoon series in this action title with superficial racing overtones. Your aim is to complete each course in a particular position, which is achieved either by waiting for them to suffer enough damage to drop out of the race, or by inflicting that damage yourself. Your car is armed with a forward-shooting arrow to impale the opposition cars, and deal with the many hazards the races throw at you, including boulders and rabbits, which can be taken out for points.
This game was never officially released on the Genesis.</desc>

		<name>Blaster Master 2</name>
		<desc>One day, four years after Jason, Eve, and Alex’s battles with the Plutonium Boss, a bolt of lightning struck Jason’s house in the land he had migrated to four years earlier and caused the ceiling to crumble, knocking him unconscious. When Jason woke up, SOPHIA 3rd NORA MA-02, which he had hidden in an abandoned barn, was in pieces and the parts he had collected four years ago from the Plutonium Boss’ mutant Underbosses were missing. Little did Jason know that there were more Lightning Beings, the kinfolk of the Plutonium Boss, and they were planning to destroy the Earth. These beings started digging towards the Earth’s core in order to shift the planet’s weight off its axis, leading to total annihilation while they sapped the underworld of plutonium. The parts from SOPHIA 3rd were being used to create a template for the robotic army to assist the Lightning Beings in accomplishing their mission. Jason knew he had to stop them, but he also knew he wouldn’t make it without the help of SOPHIA 3rd. Since he couldn’t recover the parts, he decided to redesign &amp; reconstruct it with (assumedly) the help of Eve to better prepare himself for the ordeal facing him. After 29 days, SOPHIA was completely rebuilt and ready for battle again, now known as SOPHIA 4th.

Following the Beings’ footsteps, the group jumped in their new vehicle and headed towards the (presumably) Adirondack Mountains, where their quest began anew. In the end, Jason and company triumphed over the Lightning Beings’ underworld invasion, vanquishing the Lightning being known only as the "Mutant Boss." SOPHIA 3rd's parts remained missing.</desc>

		<path>./NBA Play-Offs - Bulls Vs. Blazers # SMD.SMD</path>
		<name>Bulls vs Lakers and the NBA Playoffs</name>
		<desc>Bulls vs Lakers and the NBA Playoffs is a basketball video game developed by Electronic Arts and released in 1992 exclusively for the Sega Mega Drive. The game is the sequel to Lakers versus Celtics. The game's name refers to the previous season's NBA championship series, the 1991 NBA Finals matchup between the Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers. It is the second game in the NBA Playoffs series of games.

Although there is no SNES version for Bulls vs Lakers, the SNES (and first) version of Bulls vs. Blazers was heavily based on Bulls vs Lakers, with the later Mega Drive version introducing a few changes from this.

Bulls vs Lakers introduced a television broadcast-style presentation with a fictional television network, "EASN", the Electronic Arts Sports Network. It was the first team basketball game to feature an in-game instant replay feature. Bing Gordon, the Chief Creative Officer of Electronic Arts, was featured as the game announcer. This was also the first game to depict NBA team logos on the courts.

Gameplay[edit]
The game can be played in various ways: players could play against each other, or against the computer. Games against the computer were divided into two modes, "Exhibition" or "Playoffs". Players could pick from one of the 16 teams that competed in the 1991 NBA Playoffs. Rosters featured many top NBA stars of the time, including Michael Jordan. Games could be configured for 2, 5, 8 or 12 minute quarters. New to the series is a star underneath the player to let users easily know which player they are controlling.

It is a member of Activision's Shanghai series of mahjong solitaire games — to be precise, it is a port of the Japanese version of what the Western market got as Shanghai II: Dragon's Eye; the numbering discrepancy was because of a Japanese Shanghai II that had already been made.

Activision were not happy with this version of the game, and instead produced their own Shanghai II: Dragon's Eye for the Western market.</desc>

		<path>./Joe Montana Football # SMD.SMD</path>
		<name>Joe Montana II: Sports Talk Football</name>
		<desc>Despite its name, Joe Montana II is an almost entirely different game to the original John Madden Football, the most promient difference being that games are played "horizontally" rather than "vertically". There are also two levels of "zoom", with the camera closing in on the action when appropriate.

Also new is the concept of an in-game announcer, whose comments occur continuously in real time in accordance with the action (as opposed to the previous method of only having voice samples after plays (or in the case of other sports, hits, goals, etc.)), similar to how American football is broadcast on television. This was considered a selling point for the game, and was advertised as part of the Sports Talk series, which includes Sports Talk Baseball and this game's sequels, NFL Sports Talk Football '93 Starring Joe Montana and NFL Football '94 Starring Joe Montana (as well as College Football's National Championship).

While the concept of in-game commentary would become a standard across most forms of video game American football (and sports gamsein general), Joe Montana II stands as one of the first to bring this feature to home consoles. Here, however, the voiceover is very primitive, with sentences constructed from monotone words, lacking any sense of tone or flow.

Sega would actually move away form in-game commentary for a few years - it does not exist in NFL '95 or its sequels, nor does it appear in the Sega Mega-CD game Joe Montana's NFL Football.</desc>

		<desc>This remake of Street Fighter II featured a new scoring system that kept track of combos, first attacks, and reversals. Additionally, four new characters join the returning twelve characters from the original. Super Street Fighter II is also the first game in the SFII series to give full move sets to the boss characters. Previously in Street Fighter II: Champion Edition and Street Fighter II: Turbo, whilst the four boss characters were available, they did not have different animations for some punches and kicks. Although this was expected for Balrog (being a boxer), it was unusual to see a character doing a punch when pressing a kick button, or vice-versa.

Aside from the bosses' added moves, some of the main characters' moves were adjusted in some ways. For example, the differences between Ken and Ryu became more defined - Ryu focusing on deadlier fireballs, and Ken's fierce Dragon Punch being able to set opponents on fire.</desc>

Each of the characters has their own unique weapon. Rocky has a bo, Colt uses a katana, and Tum-tum wields twin sai. Enemies consist of rebel ninjas working for Koga, wild animals such as dogs and bats, and hazards such as moving boulders and spikes. As shown below, the game menu is a system representation of the poster used for the movie of the same name.

There are several levels to the game, each one made up of smaller zones. The game progresses by running the character through each zone, and arriving at the other end. Each level has a minor boss, with the character having to defeat Koga as the final boss. Upon retrieval of the dagger, the character rejoins the master in Japan, returning to him his stolen dagger.</desc>

		<desc>Aerobiz is a business simulation video game for the Super NES and Mega Drive/Genesis game consoles, released in 1992 by Koei. It was also released for the FM Towns, PC-9801 and X68000 computer platforms in Japan.

As CEO of a budding international airline, the player has a limited amount of time to expand their business to become the industry leader against three other airlines (either AI-controlled or human opponents). The player has an amount of control over how their airline develops, such as the name, investments, what routes to fly, plane purchases, and other various aspects, while at the mercy of world events such as politics (for instance, if the player runs his or her airline out of Moscow, he or she can initially only buy Soviet planes and will have a harder time negotiating with Western nations[2]) and natural disasters. The player can also get the company involved in peripheral businesses such as hotels and shuttle services.[1] Once Perestroika is initiated, then the Cold War restrictions no longer apply in the game.</desc>

It was later ported to the Genesis. It is a sequel to Koei's previous airline simulation game, Aerobiz.

In the game, which is essentially the same as its predecessor, the player is the CEO of a start-up international airline. The player competes with three other such companies (either AI-controlled or other players) for dominance in the worldwide travel industry. Such dominance is obtained by purchasing slots in various airports around the world, and flying routes to and from those slots. Once a route is created, the player has control of what type of planes fly the route, the price of airfare, and numerous other variables.</desc>

At your disposal is a vulcan cannon (basically a machine gun) and a limited number of missiles. In some versions of the game the guns fire automatically all the time. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.

The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. You also can speed up and slow down to deal with enemies which appear behind you.</desc>

In Air Buster, the player controls a fighter jet also designed for space travel and shoots enemies, collects power-ups, and defeats bosses to advance levels.

Ellen Ripley, the main character of the Alien series, is in cryo-sleep aboard the space ship Sulaco. Unfortunately, an alien or two has stowed away on the Sulaco, and wreaked havoc within the ship. Thus, it crash lands on the prison colony planet Fiorina 161. Ripley and the unarmed prisoners have to figure out a way to survive the aliens terrorizing the colony until help arrives.

The gameplay of the various Alien³ conversions varies from platform to platform. This version is a side-scrolling action game with large maze-like levels. In each level, you have to rescue all the trapped prisoners and then make your way to the exit, all while surviving multiple alien attacks.

		<name>Alien Soldier</name>
		<desc>Alien Soldier (エイリアンソルジャー Eirian Sorujā?) is a 1995 side-scrolling run and gun video game developed by Treasure for the Mega Drive. Retail copies were released in Japan and PAL territories while in North America it was only available exclusively via the Sega Channel cable service. The story follows a powerful being named Epsilon-Eagle, who after being nearly killed becomes determined to avenge his near death and save his planet. The character has a variety of weapons and moves that the player must master to complete the game. Many gameplay ideas are borrowed from Treasure's earlier Mega Drive release, Gunstar Heroes. However, Alien Soldier puts an emphasis on challenging boss fights with short and easy levels serving as downtime in-between.

Development lasted two years and was led by Hideyuki Suganami, who from the start wanted to make the entire game himself. He chose the Mega Drive over more powerful 32-bit hardware because he was captivated by the system's strong reputation for "action shooting" games. Critics have praised the game's for its graphics, soundtrack, and overall intensity, recommending it for fans of Gunstar Heroes and the run and gun genre. Some negative critique was directed towards the hard difficulty, steep learning curve, and unorthodox gameplay. It was ported to the PlayStation 2 in Japan, and also re-released worldwide on Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console and Steam.</desc>

		<name>Alien Storm</name>
		<desc>Alien Storm (エイリアンストーム?) is a 1990 beat 'em up arcade game by Sega. It was later ported to the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis and Sega Master System. The Sega Mega Drive version was also released on Wii's Virtual Console in 2007. The game appeared in Sega Mega Drive Ultimate Collection for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3

Alien Storm is a side-scrolling beat 'em up.[2] The game resembles Golden Axe, with a similar artistic style, three playable characters (a man, a woman, and a novelty character) and pick-up or power-up special attacks. The player (one player only on the Master System version, up to two players on the Mega Drive version, three on the arcade version) selects from the three different characters to embark upon a quest to save the Earth from an alien invasion.

All of the Busters are playable from the beginning of the game. There are 6 missions to complete (8 in the Mega Drive version) with several stages, and each mission has the player blasting aliens, from the streets to the mother ship, where the mother of all aliens can be found. This task becomes increasingly difficult with each new mission, and the aliens are capable of hiding inside objects such as plants, postboxes, trashcans, drums, and other items. Each mission has an objective such as rescuing people or destroying a UFO.

When dealing with a few aliens, flying heads will appear, which can be shot to collect life or energy. Energy is used specifically to power the energy based attacks of the player's weapon (such as flames or electricity) and to use the much more powerful special weapons.

In a similar format as other early Sega arcade games, each character has unlimited usage of various short-range attacks, i.e. punches, kicks. Along with these standard attacks, each character has their own individual weapon (Garth's weapon that shoots lightning is replaced with a flame weapon in the Master System version). Special attacks are also included, and vary depending on the character chosen at the start of the game. For instance, Garth summons a U.S. Air Force starship that drops bombs across the street (in the Master System version he has Karen's special, a ballistic missile strike). Scooter will teleport out of his present location and leave a series of bombs that will blow up on the appearance of aliens, after which he will re-appear (in the Mega Drive version he just explodes, leaving his head, which his new body returns to retrieve). Karen calls down a nuclear missile, which incinerates every foe on the screen. However, a large amount of energy is depleted by using each character's special attack, and cannot be used if the energy of the player's character is too low.

There are few bosses in the game. The arcade original only features a single boss that has three distinct forms. The Mega Drive port has two of these forms as two separate bosses. At the end of each mission, the side-scrolling gameplay shifts to either a shooting gallery perspective where the player must take out the aliens that pop out of various locations, similar to the bonus stages of Shinobi and Shadow Dancer, both also by Sega, or a running section that is similar to the side scrolling mode but plays like a horizontal shooter instead with projectile weapons.</desc>

		<desc>Another World is a platform game, where the player uses the keyboard or gamepad to make the protagonist Lester run, jump, attack or perform other actions. In the initial part of the game, Lester is weaponless, able to kick at small creatures but otherwise vulnerable. After escaping with his alien ally, Lester acquires a laser pistol from a fallen foe. The pistol has three capabilities: a standard fire mode, the abilities to create force fields to block enemy fire, and a powerful charged shot that can break through force fields and some walls. Later, Lester also gains a plasma ball that can be used like a grenade to defeat foes. Enemies will also have the same capabilities, requiring the player to take advantage of the three gun modes and the environment to overcome hostile forces and escape.
 
Lester and his alien ally cannot sustain any damage, and the game will be over if either takes a hit. However, the game uses numerous checkpoints, and the player can restart at the last point indefinitely. On older consoles without the ability to save a game, the player can write down an alphanumeric code for these checkpoints and re-enter it when restarting the game later.</desc>

They move in warships capable of travelling in Nether Space... and Earth is their next target. Now, there has been an assault on the laboratory of the renowned scientist Dr. Zerrek Keene, who, in a state near death, has summoned his granddaughter, Zana Keene. "Zana," he said, "while experimenting with Nether Space transmission, I caused a huge magnetic field to be formed around our planet, and it has attracted the attention of the barbaric Viking Terrorists." Dr. Keene pressed a keycard into her palm, and with his last breath, whispered, "Zana, use this... save Earth." Zana Keene, trained as a test pilot at the United Government Military Academy, knew what he had given her... access to the "Chameleon" ERX-75 space fighter - capable of combat in Nether Space, and of transforming itself into a robot - the strongest weapon ever developed by the United Earth Army.

To rescue her, Ryo and Robert must take on numerous enemies around South Town, eventually reaching the mysterious Mr. Karate. 

The passion of the game’s creators is evident in the unique game play elements introduced. These include an energy gauge that is depleted every time a fighter uses a special maneuver, Desperation Attacks that are usable only when a fighter’s health is low, and camera zooming that adjusts on the fly as fighters move around the stage. All these features ensure that players use strategy and tactics, rather than simply mash buttons. Adding to the mix are little touches such as characters showing cuts when they are injured and voice-over samples during cut scenes. 

Can you perfect the art of fighting and save Yuri?</desc>

		<desc>It is 50 B.C., and the entire Gaul (today's France) is conquered by the Romans. Only one village still remains independent, thanks to the incredible powers of its two great warriors, Asterix and Obelix. In the game, they must first of all liberate the village Orvio and rescue their friend Dogmatix.

The player can play as either Asterix or Obelix. They make their way through platform levels, fighting enemies by punching them, and jumping to access higher ares or to avoid falling down. There are also some items that the player can collect, such as bombs, with which the player can overcome obstacles and advance in the game.</desc>

The shield was lost to the invading Romans and Asterix must liberate the shield from their control. Players must guide Asterix through different levels in this 2D platforming game. An isometric map is used to enter different levels. Asterix has the ability to run, jump, and defeat enemies by directly hitting them.

Players can talk to non-player characters just like in a role-playing game. Other people's houses can also be visited in search of clues.</desc>

		<desc>Awesome Possum... Kicks Dr. Machino's Butt is a video game created by Tengen for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis that was released in early 1993. It also had many lines of digitized speech, unusual for its time, a feature with which the game was marketed. The box also states "it is an excellent educational game for all ages".

This video game features an anthropomorphic possum character who battles a mad scientist and his army of robots to save the world.

Awesome Possum includes environmental activist elements, with the character collecting empty bottles and cans, and answering questions about the environment to earn bonus points in his fight against the evil Dr. Machino. There are also various other animals located within levels which the character can ride to activate their ability, such as a bee which allows the character to fly or a rhino that catapults the character. There are a total of four worlds which together consist of 13 levels all together plus 12 bonus stages alongside the quiz which the character must collect as many recyclables as possible before the time expires.</desc>

The game was released for the Sega Master System, Sega Mega Drive, and the Sega Game Gear, appearing in the United States on 16 July 1992, Japan on 17 July 1992, and sometime later in 1992 in Europe. Along with boasting the most "realistic physics",[1] it was the best received console driving game at the time of release, the game was also endorsed by the then Formula One champion Ayrton Senna, who won the race more times than any other driver, with six victories, and five races consecutively between 1989 and 1993. The game's development was also assisted by Senna, who supplied his own advice about the tracks featured in the game.</desc>

		<desc>Back to the Future III is a collection of four arcade games. Marty McFly and Doc Brown have traveled back through time to the year 1885 - and they're soon deep in trouble when they face "Mad Dog" Tannen's gang and have to find a way to return to the present. This game takes four scenes from the Hollywood movie Back to the Future III and turns them into arcade sequences:
•Buckboard Chase: Doc Brown goes horseback in an attempt to save Hill Valley's lovely school teacher Clara. This game of quick ducking, jumping and shooting alternates between a side-scrolling and a top-down perspective.
•Shooting Gallery: The name says it all. A classic game of aim-and-shoot, spiced up by hidden extras and bonus targets.
•Pie Throwing: Meet the Mad Dog gang. They have guns, and you have... cream pies. It's an isometric version of the shooting gallery, only with ammo. And the targets shoot back.
•The Train: Basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up on train wagons with some ducking and jumping. Get rid of the mechanics and collect speed logs to push the engine to a magic 88 mph.</desc>

		<desc>In this game, the objective is to move Barney around four themed levels and locate five children (including the Baby Bop character) and five presents (ball, teddy bear, rubber duck, truck, doll) that are hiding throughout the level. Unlike action games, the player is not allowed to die; a lack of a proper health bar also indicates Barney's inability to die. The game emphasizes safety; should Barney try to fall from a ledge, a safety lecture is given. Should the player find all the children and presents in different levels, they would be rewarded with a "special surprise". During the surprise, the purple balloons are popped while confetti and streamers are drizzled in the presence of excited children in addition to Barney and Baby Bop.

When nowhere near an object to interact with, Barney can blow kisses in the air complete with flying heart symbols. Locating a child results in giving him or her a hug. Barney can even fly on balloons, float on clouds, and jump on nearby platforms. Sound quality can be questionable on certain parts; "fish" tends to be one of the words that the game has trouble vocalizing correctly.</desc>

Battle Master is a squad-based action-adventure game viewed from a top-down isometric perspective.

At each destination the player may choose to parley - giving an opportunity to purchase useful items from the destination, rather than having to find them - or may enter the destination.</desc>

Once all three icons are red, the player automatically loses the fight. The arena is surrounded by an electric fence that can either be used for an attack or as a way to initiate a jump attack. It very difficult to pull off a close attack from behind. However, these attacks have the distinct advantage of being irreversible by the opponent. Regular matches are like exhibitions while tournaments are more like role-playing games where the player's chosen beast/dragon is weak and has to power up by defeating stronger foes. A store can be visited which provided strength-increasing food between fights in the arena. Diskettes containing the vital statistics of the different monsters, dragons, and miscellaneous beasts can also be found. They provide vital knowledge needed to defeat future opponents.[</desc>

He can sometimes locate items within a level to restore some of his health, and the game provides unlimited continues. It was often described as having a high difficulty level.</desc>

		<name>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon</name>
		<desc>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon (美少女戦士セーラームーン) is a side-scrolling beat 'em up arcade game developed by Arc System Works and TNS and published by Ma-Ba, based on the Sailor Moon anime &amp; manga series.  This version was never released outside Japan.

Overview:
Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon ("Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon" or "Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon") is the first video game adaptation of the popular anime of the same name, which in turn was based on a shoujo manga about female high school students who transform into superheroes with planet-related names.

Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon was developed by Arc System Works, back when they were a contract developer producing licensed games for other publishers, and published by Angel (a subsidiary of Bandai) in Japan in August 1993. The game was later released in France as Sailor Moon, mirroring the earlier France-only release of another SNES anime license game Dragon Ball Z: Super Butouden (which was simply named Dragon Ball Z in France). The game did not receive a UK or US release.

Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon would also receive a Sega Mega Drive port in 1994, which was developed and published by Ma-Ba (another Bandai subsidiary). It replaced some of the graphics and stages, and almost all of the music. It also included a new final boss, who only appeared on the game's Hard Mode.

Gameplay:
The game is a fairly standard brawler, with five playable characters. They include:

Sailor Moon - The heroine of the franchise, recognizable by her long blonde pigtails. Standard all-rounder character.
Sailor Mercury - The short-haired brunette and the brains of the outfit. She's faster than the other characters, but she's also the smallest and has the shortest reach.
Sailor Mars - The long-haired brunette. Sailor Mars is feisty and musically-inclined, and most of her repertoire involves fire in some capacity. Her regular attack is a stronger kick, rather than a punch.
Sailor Jupiter - Wears her brown hair in a ponytail. The muscles of the group, Jupiter's attacks are the strongest of any of the playable characters.
Sailor Venus - The other blonde. She uses a chain in battle, and is the only character to use a weapon. This gives her a longer reach than the other characters.
The player, as any one of the five Sailor Soldiers, must progress through five different stages which culminates with a trip to the Dark Kingdom to fight Queen Beryl. Each character fights slightly differently, and each has a different special attack which requires charging up before they can be unleashed. Each character also has a special attack that consumes health when used.</desc>

		<name>Blaster Master 2</name>
		<desc>One day, four years after Jason, Eve, and Alex’s battles with the Plutonium Boss, a bolt of lightning struck Jason’s house in the land he had migrated to four years earlier and caused the ceiling to crumble, knocking him unconscious. When Jason woke up, SOPHIA 3rd NORA MA-02, which he had hidden in an abandoned barn, was in pieces and the parts he had collected four years ago from the Plutonium Boss’ mutant Underbosses were missing. Little did Jason know that there were more Lightning Beings, the kinfolk of the Plutonium Boss, and they were planning to destroy the Earth. These beings started digging towards the Earth’s core in order to shift the planet’s weight off its axis, leading to total annihilation while they sapped the underworld of plutonium. The parts from SOPHIA 3rd were being used to create a template for the robotic army to assist the Lightning Beings in accomplishing their mission. Jason knew he had to stop them, but he also knew he wouldn’t make it without the help of SOPHIA 3rd. Since he couldn’t recover the parts, he decided to redesign &amp; reconstruct it with (assumedly) the help of Eve to better prepare himself for the ordeal facing him. After 29 days, SOPHIA was completely rebuilt and ready for battle again, now known as SOPHIA 4th.

Following the Beings’ footsteps, the group jumped in their new vehicle and headed towards the (presumably) Adirondack Mountains, where their quest began anew. In the end, Jason and company triumphed over the Lightning Beings’ underworld invasion, vanquishing the Lightning being known only as the "Mutant Boss." SOPHIA 3rd's parts remained missing.</desc>

		<desc>Bonanza Bros. is a shooter, platform game where taking the role of one or both of the brothers, Robo (1P, red) and Mobo (2P, blue) (Mike and Spike in some PAL versions), who were modeled after The Blues Brothers. The object of the game is for the player(s) to stealthily move inside a house avoiding guards, retrieve several objects and move to the roof where a blimp is expecting the player with the loot. In this fashion the plot and the gameplay resembles the older Atari 2600 title Keystone Kapers but with added features that are similar to the ones in Lock 'n' Chase. Two players can play cooperatively at the same time, as the screen is always split in two.

The places the brothers burgle include a bank, a millionaire's mansion, a casino, a mint, an art gallery and a treasury. While similar in graphics and gameplay, the story changes from the original Japanese to the early western versions: in the former, the Bonanza Bros. are thieves; in the latter, they are testing the security facilities or helping the police recovering evidence.

The player can walk, jump, shoot and move behind a column or large furniture, which allows both hiding and dodging shots from the guards, which can't be neutralized definitively, only stunned for a few seconds using the gun or pressing a door against them. They are alerted by sounds or with the Brothers entering their field of vision, and then either hide, call for help or fire against the player. If the player is hit, he drops all objects and loses a life. Some guards have a riot shield and can only be hit when moving away.</desc>

		<desc>Bubsy 2 is a platform video game, the sequel to Bubsy in Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind, and the second game in the Bubsy series.[4] It was released in 1994 for the Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo, and Game Boy.

In his second platformer, Bubsy the Bobcat must explore a mysterious museum filled with portals leading to different worlds! What could possibly go wrong?

Overview:
Bubsy II is a 2D platformer developed and published by Accolade for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis in 1994. The sequel to Bubsy: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind, Bubsy II puts players back in the role of Bubsy, the wise-cracking anthropomorphic bobcat, as he sets off through the Amazatorium (a museum full of portals to different worlds) to defeat the tyrannical anthropomorphic pig leader, Oinkton P. Hamm.

Unlike the previous game, Bubsy can enter any of the six worlds he wants to at any time (with the exception of the last world, which must be unlocked by completing the other five). He also now has a health system (in which he can take up to three hits from normal enemies before he dies, unless he finds a special healing item) and multiple gadgets that can be purchased by collecting trading cards (such as a "smart bomb", a diving suit, a cartoonish black hole to hide in, and ammo for his toy weapon). Score-giving yarnballs are now replaced with marbles, and the "Woolies" are replaced with various baddies.</desc>

		<name>Buck Rogers: Countdown to Doomsday</name>
		<desc>Buck Rogers: Countdown to Doomsday retains most of the story and the core gameplay of the computer version of the same name, but differs in several gameplay- and interface-related aspects.

The main differences involve reduction of some of the skills and equipment types present in the computer version. Limitations have been imposed on character creation as well: there are only four character classes (Warrior, Rocketjock, Medic, and Rogue) and three races (Human, Desert Runner, and Tinker) to choose from, as opposed to five character classes and six races in the computer release.</desc>

The player has a realistic range of moves and must use them wisely, as Ki (life-force) is drained for every move made, whether successful or not, and both this and your stamina level must be kept high.</desc>

		<desc>Caliber.50 is a top-down run and gun video game originally released in arcades (as Cal.50) before being brought to the Sega Mega Drive in 1991. The Mega Drive version was only released in North America.
The Mega Drive version is severely watered down from the arcade original, not just in terms of graphics and sound, but also gameplay, as the controls need to be mapped to three buttons. This means unlike the arcade original B takes the roll of shooting and throwing grenades, A rotates left and C rotates right. The arcade cabinet used special joysticks which could be spun around to rotate the player. To compenstate, there are fewer enemies on screen, and the player is given a life bar.</desc>

Of course, Death appeared and challenged Chakan with a proposition. If Chakan could defeat him, he'd be granted eternal life. However, if Chakan was defeated, he'd become Death's eternal servant. In another side-story, Chakan was so feared by the elders of multiple tribes, they dropped their petty differences and amassed to figure out a way to defeat or contain him, and upon overhearing his boasting, summoned the Grim Reaper themselves, informed the Reaper of his boastings, and contracted him to defeat Chakan.

The battle raged on for several days, spells and swords clashed, until the ultimate victor was very clear...Chakan. Because he defeated Death eventually, he was granted his "reward":

“You are a tactful swordsman, so I will not renege on our wager. I grant you the kiss of eternal life, but, for your arrogance and pride I will temper my gift with this curse. You will be a mere shell of yourself as I strip you of most of your powers. Each nightfall, evils will be shown to you, and the pain of their victims will be your pain. You will never know rest as you wander this world searching to slay the horrors that haunt your sleeping world. You will suffer grievous wounds, but you will not die, and as eternity rolls on, you will crave my touch. Your face will bear my visage, and your eyes will burn with hellfire. But...let it not be said that I am without mercy. There shall be an end to your curse. If all the beasts of the dark are slain, then you may find rest."

Chakan will live forever until he destroys the four supernatural evils of the terrestrial plane (Spider-Queen, Mantis, Elkenrod, and Dragonfly King) and the elemental plane (Parasite, Tundra Beast, the Last Dragon and the Leader of the Dragonfly Clan).</desc>

		<name>Clue</name>
		<desc>Up to six players can play, using any controller. The object of the game, as in the board game, is to find out who killed Mr. Boddy where and with what.

Each player is dealt a number of cards. All the cards held eliminate the suspect, weapon, or room on the card. Each player can view their own cards during their turn. A die is rolled, and the six players (represented by the six suspects Miss Scarlet, Col. Mustard, Mrs. White, Mr. Green, Mrs. Peacock, and Prof. Plum(Know as Prof. Fart[citation needed] in Brazil)) move around the board. Upon entering one of the nine rooms on the board, the player must make a suggestion, choosing a suspect and a weapon (the room the player is in is automatically chosen.) A vignette is shown, showing who or what was in that room, or who held the weapon. This would result in a clue given, such as "Miss Scarlet was in the Lounge" or "No one had the wrench." On the highest difficulty, the clues given are less broad, like in the board game, with clues only given that the chosen suspect or weapon was or wasn't in the room. The suspect chosen in the suggestion is moved to that room.

A player can, on their turn, make an interrogation, wherein they can choose a suspect, a weapon, and a room. A longer vignette is shown, playing out the scenario as the player chose. Example: "The lounge was warm. It was cozy enough for a nap... A long nap. Miss Scarlet laughed as she fixed her hair. She picked up the pipe." At this point, one of the other players, if they are in possession of a card that eliminates any of those factors, shows on screen that they have proof that the scenario could not have happened. If none of the other players are in possession of such a card, the interrogating player is not proved wrong. Players may make two interrogations per game.

A player can, on their turn, make an accusation, which plays out similar to an interrogation, unless if the player is incorrect, they are eliminated from the game. If they are correct, the actual suspect is seen killing Mr. Boddy in an addition to the vignette and is then seen being arrested. The accusing player is the winner.</desc>

		<path>./Columns # SMD.SMD</path>
		<name>Columns</name>
		<desc>The game takes place inside a tall, rectangular playing area, as in Tetris. Columns of three different symbols (such as differently-colored jewels) appear, one at a time, at the top of the well and fall to the bottom, landing either on the floor or on top of previously-fallen "Columns".

While a column is falling, the player can move it left and right, and can also cycle the positions of the symbols within it.

If, after a column has fallen, there are three or more of the same symbols connected in a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, those symbols disappear. The pile of columns then settles under gravity. If this causes three or more other symbols to become aligned, they also disappear and the pile settles again. This process repeats as many times as necessary. It is not uncommon for this to happen three or four times in a row - it often happens by accident when the well is becoming crowded. If the well fills beyond the top of the screen, the game ends.

Occasionally, a special column called the Magic Jewel appears. The Magic Jewel flashes with different colors and when it lands, it destroys all the jewels with the same color as the one underneath it.

Like Tetris, the columns fall at a faster rate as the player progresses. The goal of the game is to play for as long as possible before the well fills up with symbols.

Some ports of the game offer alternate game modes as well. "Flash columns" involves mining their way through a set number of lines to get to a flashing jewel at the bottom. "Doubles" allows two players work together in the same well. "Time trial" involves racking up as many points as possible within the time limit.</desc>

		<desc>Crüe Ball is a 1992 pinball video game developed by Electronic Arts for the Mega Drive/Genesis. It was inspired by the glam metal band Mötley Crüe and featured three Crüe songs: "Dr. Feelgood", "Live Wire" and "Home Sweet Home". The game's soundtrack by Brian L. Schmidt features heavy metal-style music.

The game's prototype name was Twisted Flipper. The producer of the game, Richard Robbins, initially pursued the name "Headbanger Ball", but MTV balked at a license and Mötley Crüe was added relatively late in development.

This game was designed by two people who actually worked on pinball games: Mark Sprenger (artist for such games as 1984's Space Shuttle, 1986's High Speed and 1990's Diner) and Brian L. Schmidt (composer for Space Station, Black Knight 2000 and various pinball games by Data East Pinball/Sega Pinball (now Stern Pinball, Inc.).</desc>

		<name>Death Duel</name>
		<desc>Taking place in the future year 2140, the nine of the ten Galactic Federations had gained unwarranted control over galaxy flight traffic and territory. This has caused the one remaining Federation to suffer a loss of supplies and space pirate attacks. The dispute can only be settled through a warranted duel with the Federation’s one duelist to fight against the collective nine alien duelists representing the nine Galactic Federations in control of the space traffic ways, otherwise known as The Super 9’s. The player assumes the role of Barrett Jade, a mecha pilot to win back the space ways and duel against the nine other duelists.

Players started the game off with their first duel with a set number of ammunition for their weapons; the player’s robot had a total of three weapons indicated by all three buttons on the controller. Once the player completed the duel, they would go through a type of Bonus Stage that would qualify them for the next duel as well as increase their score and money. Players could then purchase more ammunition or even new weapons for their robot at a local shop. Players had to time their attacks and aim precisely for key locations of their opponents body. Some enemies could regenerate missing parts of their body (including their head) while some enemies depended on particular mechanical parts to evade fire. If the player ran out of ammunition for all their weapons before the duel was over, they would lose a life and restart the duel over (with the same amount of ammunition they started the duel with). If the duel timer ran out before the duel was over, the player would also lose a life and restart the duel.</desc>

But his wife's father is murdered by a local gangster named Big Boy Caprice, and Dick Tracy is now out for revenge. The game doesn't follow the exact plot of the movie, but simply lets Dick Tracy fight his way through several levels until he faces his archenemy.

This is a platform shooter/"beat-'em-up" game. Plenty of gunmen will attack our hero from all the sides. Dick can only move to the right or to the left. He can use his pistol gun to take out enemies who are in front or behind him. Since he can't approach enemies who attack from the depth of the screen, he can dispose of them using his machine gun. When the enemy is too close, Dick will punch him instead of shooting.</desc>

It is considered by many to be the "true" sequel to Kick Off 2 (in preference to the official Kick Off 3), as Kick Off's creator Dino Dini had moved from Anco Software and was responsible for all Goal's engineering and game design. Goal! introduced improved dynamics and A.I. over Kick Off 2, as well as other innovative features, such as multiple camera views. The game shipped 60,000 units on the first day of release.</desc>

Rather than the traditional power-ups, Dynamite Headdy enables you to swap your head for different kinds – such as heads that heal you or heads that stick on to walls. You use your head in order to climb up on platforms as well, as you can grab hold of things with it, and on certain stages of the Mega Drive/Genesis version it is used to turn the game into a side-scrolling shooter, as you gain a propeller, jet, or bird head. Basically, Dynamite Headdy is just a traditional platformer at heart.</desc>

		<desc>El Viento (エル・ヴィエント Eru Viento?, derived from Spanish meaning "The Wind") is a 2D platform video game released by Wolf Team and published by Renovation Products for the Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis game console in 1991. It is the second in a trilogy of games, which include Earnest Evans and Anett Futatabi.
The game possesses many references to H. P. Lovecraft's esteemed Cthulhu Mythos.
The game shares the same fictional universe with Earnest Evans, and happens several years later.

New York City, 1928. A mad religious leader known as Henry seeks to awaken the ancient and malevolent god Hastur. A sorceress named Restiana offers herself to Henry as a sacrifice for a cause which will bring the inevitable down fall of mankind.

There are some people that have descended from Hastur's ancient bloodline, one of which is the young Peruvian sorceress, Annet Myer. With some assistance from Earnest Evans, Annet attempts to stop the cult from resurrecting Hastur using the very spells of this bloodline.</desc>

		<name>Empire of Steel</name>
		<desc>Steel Empire (originally released as Koutetsu Teikoku in Japan, and otherwise known in various English materials as The Steel Empire or Empire of Steel), is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up video game released on the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive home consoles in 1992, and was later ported to the Nintendo Game Boy Advance in 2004.

Steel Empire is notable amongst shoot 'em up games for its unique aesthetic designs. Mostly low-tech in nature, with it being set in the late-19th century of an alternate world, the game's aircraft, weaponry, powerups, environments, enemies and bosses are heavily stylized adding strong steampunk elements to the style, themes and visuals of the game. Steam power, propeller-based aircraft, biplanes, dirigibles and heavily-armored steam trains with giant cannons play large roles in the game's protagonists and opponents.</desc>

		<name>ESWAT: City under Siege</name>
		<desc>ESWAT: City under Siege, released in Japan as Cyber Police ESWAT (サイバーポリス イースワット?),[1][2] is a 1990 side scrolling platform video game for the Sega Mega Drive and Genesis video game consoles.

City under Siege was based on the arcade game Cyber Police ESWAT released a year earlier in 1989. The console game maintains the main characters, plot and some of its enemies from the arcade game, but features some different levels, weapons, and bonuses.

The game is a sidescrolling platformer similar to Shinobi. The game is set in the near future, where the player controls a blonde police officer named Duke Oda (デューク・オダ?) who, over a series of levels, turns into the cyborg E.S.W.A.T. At first, as a rookie member of the Cyber Police force in the city of Liberty, the player has to clean the streets of an overwhelming crime wave and terminate the most wanted criminals. In the first and second levels of the game, the completely human Duke Oda can only utilize a single shot weapon and can only survive one hit. A second hit will kill him.

A mysterious and high-tech organization, named "E.Y.E.", quickly threatens to take over the entire city and, after being promoted at the end of the second level, Duke Oda is given power armor called the "ICE Combat Suit". With this suit the player can use new and more lethal weapons; "Super Shot", a plasma rifle, rockets, and a devastating fire attack if he finds them. The player also has access to a jet pack with limited fuel that replenishes over time. Finally, this armor will allow the player to take more damage before being defeated. Unfortunately, because the suit makes him larger, it is harder for him to dodge enemy attacks. The final boss of the game, the leader of E.Y.E., is revealed to be a robot with artificial intelligence that is attempting to replicate its own ICE Combat Suits to take over Liberty.</desc>

An alien being, known only as the Eternal Champion, brings back the fighters into a competition for one reason: to find one among them worthy of being resurrected, giving them a chance to avert their death and tip the balance between good and evil.

The fighters range from different eras of Earth's History: Larcen, the cat burglar. Jetta, the circus acrobat. Blade, the futuristic bounty hunter. Midknight, the vampiric bio-chemist. Rax, the cyborg. Shadow, the corporate assassin. Slash, the neanderthal. Trident, a Atlantean warrior. And Xavier, a warlock and alchemist.</desc>

		<name>European Club Soccer</name>
		<desc>European Club Soccer has dozens of teams from all across Europe (around 170), and each country is represented by at least two teams. In addition to correct club names, it also has recognizable imitations of team badges and kits; although more elaborate kits (such as those worn by Juventus, FC Porto or Celtic F.C.) are simplified (Juventus have a silver shirt, Porto blue and Celtic green). Player names, on the other hand, were made by mixing names found on real squads. Portuguese teams, for instance, had a large number of Yugoslavian players in the early 1990s, and that was reflected by players with names such as Valentim Ivic (of Valentim Loureiro and Tomislav Ivic, then Boavista FC chairman and S.L. Benfica manager, respectively). Names could not be changed, and since the game lacked a battery, it does not store changes done to kits and passwords were used to resume tournaments (example of a password sheet). Rotherham United are included amongst the English clubs despite never playing in the top tier of English football, this is due to the developer, Krisalis Software, being based in Rotherham. All other clubs have played in their own country's top tier.</desc>

The game was originally intended to be released in time for Christmas in 1990, but because of a legal action between Codemasters and Nintendo over the Game Genie the title was released in April 1991, making it miss the Christmas rush it was originally slated for. Furthermore only sold 125,000 units instead of the expected 500,000.[citation needed] Despite this, the game was awarded the 'NES Adventure Game of the Year 1991' by Game Players Magazine and given the coveted 'Parents Choice Award'.[citation needed]</desc>

		<desc>FIFA International Soccer is a 1993 sports video game developed by EA Canada's Extended Play Productions team and published by Electronic Arts. Based on the sport of association football, the game tasks the player with controlling a football team. The game was released for the Sega Mega Drive console in December 1993 and ported to numerous other systems in 1994.

The game was positively received on release; critics lauded the detail and animation of the footballers in the game, the crowd sound effects and the overall presentation. The speed the game ran at and issues with the response to the player's input were seen as the game's primary faults. The game sold well, served as a pack-in game for the Goldstar 3DO,[1] and led to a sequel, FIFA Soccer 95. It was the first game in the FIFA series.</desc>

		<desc>Fire Shark, released in Japan as Same! Same! Same! (鮫！鮫！鮫！), is a 1989 arcade shoot-'em-up by Toaplan ported to the Sega Mega Drive in 1990. This is one of the few Mega Drive ports developed by Toaplan themselves.

Like many of the Mega Drive Toaplan ports, each regional release of the game contains multiple regional versions, of which European and US settings "Fire Shark" is slightly easier than Japan setting "鮫！鮫！鮫！". Unusually, the carts released in each region appear to be slightly different; actual differences are currently unknown.

On an alternate Earth, heavy-arms producing nation S Corps starts invading other countries, and the Tiger Shark, a biplane, seems to be the only hope for stopping S Corps. There are three endings, depending on the difficulty level.</desc>

		<name>Flink</name>
		<desc>Flink (released in North America as The Misadventures of Flink), is a 2D scrolling platform video game developed by Psygnosis.

The Amiga CD32 and Sega CD versions are reliant on CD-ROM media to store large levels, highly detailed graphics, and high-quality music. The Mega Drive version is a cut-down version.

Flink is one of the few Amiga CD32 titles not to see a release for the Amiga home computer system, on which the CD32's hardware was based. The majority of titles released for the CD32 were essentially the versions developed for Amiga home computers, taking only minor advantage of the CD-ROM medium with extra levels, CD audio, and/or FMV sequences.

The creators, Erwin Kloibhofer and Henk Nieborg, were also responsible for the games The Adventures of Lomax and Lionheart.</desc>

		<desc>It's the year 300x. The Earth has been ravaged by careless humans, leaving an uninhabitable, polluted wasteland. The space terrorists, Gulfer, plan to harvest the pollution to make some sort of garbage weapon. The good guys, the Leezaluth, aren't happy about that, so they decide they have to blow up the Earth before Gulfer gets at it. They give Earth an ultimatum: destroy Gulfer or Leezaluth destroys Earth. To help them out, Leezaluth gives Earth's last hero, Dan, a special weapon: the TOZ system.

Why don't the Leezaluth just stop Gulfer themselves? It's not exactly clear.

So, we have the premise for a side scrolling shooter. The star attraction here is the TOZ system. The TOZ is an orb that follows your ship around, and can be shot at enemy ships to absorb their weapons. Using the TOZ, Dan will fight through 8 stages filled with lots of enemies and really large bosses.</desc>

Completely different than the Activision title of the same name, the Genesis "Ghostbusters" is a side-scrolling platformer that has the boys in gray running through houses, apartments, a burning house and a high-rise for starters as they battle a myriad of ghosts with their proton blasters. When the Ghostbusters face off against a boss ghost, they have the ability to trap them the traditional way.

Peter, Ray and Egon, each have different abilities, and can purchase weapon and life upgrades from shops throughout the levels. Other familiar faces make an appearance, as Slimer offers power-ups, and the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man returns to settle the score from the movie. 

Solve the mystery of the tablet, and the Ghostbusters have to face off against Jenna, the Goddess of Death and Destruction. Can the boys save New York one more time?</desc>

		<desc>Gods is a 1991 video game by The Bitmap Brothers where the player is cast as Hercules (here known as DRQ) in his quest to achieve immortality. The game was first made for Amiga and Atari ST computers and then ported for various other platforms. Like other Bitmap Brothers' games, Gods was highly praised by critics thanks to the quality graphics and music.

The enemy AI was praised - it would adapt not only to the player position, but also to his skill. Some rooms contain inaccessible items - smaller "thieves" show up from a passage in the wall, try to grab the item and bring it back to another point in the room or disappear with it. The player is able to obtain the item if they shoot the thief at the correct time. Bonuses are awarded for reaching certain parts of the level under a certain limit of time or number of lives, bringing an object to a room or simply by playing poorly, where the game helps the player.

As was common with Bitmap Brothers, an external musician assured the game score, this time John Foxx as Nation 12.[1] The box cover illustration was designed by the British comic book artist Simon Bisley.</desc>

An evil entity known as Death Adder has captured the King and his daughter, and holds them captive in their castle. He also finds the Golden Axe, the magical emblem of Yuria, and threatens to destroy both the axe and the royal family unless the people of Yuria accept him as their ruler. The character of Death Adder and the stolen Golden Axe could well be traced to the historical event of the Acquisition of the True Cross during the Sassanid-Byzantine wars, as the Norse mythology is heavily influenced by Greek and Middle Eastern mythologies.
The player controls one of three Warriors. The first is a battle axe-wielding dwarf, Gilius Thunderhead, from the mines of Wolud, whose twin brother was killed by the soldiers of Death Adder. Another is a male barbarian, Ax Battler, wielding a two handed broadsword looking for revenge for the murder of his mother. The last is a long-sword-wielding Tyris Flare, an amazon, whose parents were both killed by Death Adder.</desc>

In Grind Stormer the ship always moves at a fast speed and the player can collect bombs that damage the entire screen and fend off bullets. The other variant V Five takes a Gradius-approach to power-ups, having the player advance through a selection of power-ups shown on the right by collecting tokens. In the first mode power-ups are immediately applied.

		<name>Gunstar Heroes</name>
		<desc>Gunstar Heroes is a side scrolling shooter. The player has four weapons to choose from, and they can be combined in various pairs to create a total of 14 unique weapons. In addition to the weapons, the player can engage enemies in close quarters combat. It is possible to grab and toss enemies, perform sliding and jumping attacks and a long-range skid.

Unlike most games in the genre, the player has a life total calculated in numbers. Death to a player requires multiple hits but just one death will issue the option to continue from the start of the level or to end the game. Players have unlimited continues.

The main highlight of the game are its boss encounters, which often feature large enemies made up of multiple sprites allowing for fluid movement.</desc>

		<name>Hard Drivin'</name>
		<desc>Hard Drivin '​ is a driving arcade game that invites players to test drive a high-powered sports car on stunt and speed courses. The game featured one of the first 3D polygon driving environments[3] via a simulator cabinet, rendered with a custom architecture.[4] The force feedback, car physics simulator, game design and most game programming were done by Max Behensky.[citation needed] According to the in-game credit screen, Hard Drivin' was designed by two teams working concurrently in the United States and Ireland.

Development began in 1988. Atari also originally intended to release the game in 1988. However, according to one of Atari's Engineer and designer, it was delayed due to the dispute from its Vice President claiming that no one would buy an arcade cabinet for $10,000 after The Last Starfighter arcade game was canceled for the same reason a few years ago earlier. After weeks of research, it was decided that $10,000 was an acceptable price point.[5] [6] [7]

Hard Drivin '​ was released in February 1989,[1][3][8] when arcade driving games were largely implemented with scaled 2D sprites, such as Pole Position and OutRun, and when filled-polygon 3D graphics of any kind were rare in games. Hard Drivin '​ is the second commercially released arcade racing game to use 3D polygons, after Winning Run.

In total, there are fifteen variations of the arcade unit. The eleven cockpit and four compact machines included various British, German and Japanese versions.

Hard Drivin' sold 3,318 video game arcade cabinets.[1] The PC games Stunt Driver and Stunts were released after Hard Drivin '​ and shared many elements with it.</desc>

		<desc>The ghost of a teenager seeks revenge against a snobbish family. Your job is to scare them out of their house(s). They can't see you so your only means of scaring them is by possessing various objects throughout the household. For example, possessing a piece of furniture would cause something to fly out from it and possessing an object would make it come alive in some way or another. You need to act quickly because you have something called "ecto" which acts as the fuel that allows you to roam the real world. You're awarded more ecto each time a family member exists the room. The more scares you did, the more ecto you gain. Losing all ecto sends you to the underworld where you have to regain your ecto to full capacity in order to go back into the real world.</desc>

		<desc>Sometime in Earth's future, it came to mankind's realization that the Earth's natural resources were starting to decline, but despite every nation's attempts, the Earth's environment and resources continued thin. Suddenly, an alien race appeared in the Solar System. Hailing from the planet Akirov, the aliens had been observing Earth for centuries and arrived in order to save it. With their technological help, Earth's environment was replenished and Human's were able to travel deeper into space. By the year 2102, mankind was finally at peace thanks to the Akirovians.

Ten years later, a plot to enslave mankind was discovered to be a part of the Akirovian's plans and a war waged between the two. Eight years later, the Akirovians lost and left the Solar System. The primary machines for Earth's victory came from original Akirovian designed machines: giant remote controlled robots first used to design and repair Earth's satellite and colony structures. The robots were favored as Earth's primary line of defense and were dubbed the Heavy D.O.L.L's (Defensive Offensive Lethal Liberator).

Now taking place in 2120, the prospect of earning the highest combat ranking for a Heavy D.O.L.L, the rank of Heavy Nova, has become a long desired military rank. The player assumes the role of such a person attempting to earn that rank who must go through training and combat situations to prove their abilities.</desc>

		<desc>In the year 2998, humanity has finally reached the stars, and was able to build a prosperous, peaceful society. However, a space matter known as the Black Nebula began to spread, threatening to engulf the galaxies controlled by humans. It turned out that a robotic dictator named Super Mech was behind this occurrence. The Earth sends Captain Lancer, a skillful pilot navigating the powerful CNCS1 aircraft, equipped with the most powerful weapon: the Hellfire...

This is a horizontal space shooter, with the traditional premise of a lone pilot traversing hostile areas and out-manoeuvring and/or destroying quick and numerous enemies. What sets this shooter apart from many other horizontal space shooters is that you choose the direction of your shots at any time between forward, backward, upward+downward and 4-way diagonal. The 4-way diagonal shot is usually the most effective and makes for some interesting gameplay setups, such as stationary guns you can only reach by passing them (while avoiding their shots) and then placing yourself diagonally above them. There is also a bomb to take out multiple enemies. The game has a standard set of pickups: P icons for powering the weapons, S icons for increasing ship speed, B icons for bombs, and score icons.</desc>

		<name>Hua Mu Lan: Mulan</name>
		<desc>Hua Mu Lan: Mulan is an unlicensed action game by some unknown developer for the Sega Mega Drive made some unknown year. It is based on either the Chinese legend of Hua Mulan or the 1998 Disney film of the same name — which it steals art from, giving us a potential earliest release date. Some of its music is stolen from another unlicensed game, Chuanpu's 1996 Ya Se Chuan Shuo; whether or not the rest is also stolen has yet to be determined.

Interestingly enough, the game has a story screen... in Chinese, English, Spanish, Portugese, and Arabic. The stories appear to be identical: during the Tang Dynasty, the Hun warlord Tan-Yu led his soldiers to seize the dynasty, and Tang conscripts all men to fight the oncoming forces. Hua Mulan, not wanting to see her old father fight, goes in to fight for him.

The game is a typical platformer. B attacks and C jumps.</desc>

Along the usual offering of lobs, volleys, passing shots, top spins and slashes, the player can leave player movement to the console, and just focus on hitting the ball with the right shot with the correct timing (the player can also set the playing style, from all-court, baseline, or rush net). For those needing a boost of confidence before entering competitive play, Vic Braden, one of the most well known tennis coaches, has a court with special lines, a ball machine and some hints to help them improve their play.</desc>

Dr Maybe is holding Santa's workers hostage (in most versions of the game they are penguins, in some they are elves), and has turned many of Santa's helpers into his own twisted and dangerous assistants. James Pond is recruited to infiltrate Santa's grotto, free the captive penguins, retrieve the stolen toys for the children of the world, and defeat Dr Maybe once and for all. This time, however, due to the greater risks involved in this mission, Pond is given a robotic suit and the code name "RoboCod" (a pun on RoboCop). This suit gives Pond superhuman strength and agility as well as enabling him to stretch his midsection almost indefinitely and reach otherwise impossibly high areas.</desc>

Development is presumed to have taken place around 1994/1995 - a Game Boy version saw a release in PAL territories in 1994, with a similar Super Nintendo version being released in early 1995. No versions of the game have ever been released outside of PAL regions.

It is entirely unrelated to another Super Nintendo game, Jelly Boy 2 which also wound up being cancelled - Jelly Boy 2 is actually a sequel to the Super Nintendo game Jerry Boy, known as Smart Ball outside of Japan.

It is unknown why Jelly Boy was cancelled. Review copies were sent to the gaming press and a fully playable prototype has since been dumped and released online.</desc>

		<desc>The gameplay is based on fighting a lot of monsters in classic arcade platform kind of way. To do this you have at your disposal rings, two which you begin with and further more that you gain along the way. Each ring is of one of the four elements and by combining them you gain different effects. Rings of opposite elements cancel each other but you have to hands and two attack buttons so you can use say water on the one and fire on the other. The rings are also different in strength which further adds some complexity.</desc>

		<name>Joe Montana II: Sports Talk Football</name>
		<desc>Despite its name, Joe Montana II is an almost entirely different game to the original John Madden Football, the most promient difference being that games are played "horizontally" rather than "vertically". There are also two levels of "zoom", with the camera closing in on the action when appropriate.

Also new is the concept of an in-game announcer, whose comments occur continuously in real time in accordance with the action (as opposed to the previous method of only having voice samples after plays (or in the case of other sports, hits, goals, etc.)), similar to how American football is broadcast on television. This was considered a selling point for the game, and was advertised as part of the Sports Talk series, which includes Sports Talk Baseball and this game's sequels, NFL Sports Talk Football '93 Starring Joe Montana and NFL Football '94 Starring Joe Montana (as well as College Football's National Championship).

While the concept of in-game commentary would become a standard across most forms of video game American football (and sports gamsein general), Joe Montana II stands as one of the first to bring this feature to home consoles. Here, however, the voiceover is very primitive, with sentences constructed from monotone words, lacking any sense of tone or flow.

Sega would actually move away form in-game commentary for a few years - it does not exist in NFL '95 or its sequels, nor does it appear in the Sega Mega-CD game Joe Montana's NFL Football.</desc>

		<name>John Madden Football '92</name>
		<desc>John Madden Football '92, released as Pro Football in Japan, is a football video game. It features John Madden on the cover. Madden Football '92 is the sequel to John Madden Football. New aspects of this version include instant replay, two-player cooperative play, quarterback injuries, review and overturn pass interference calls, and more audibles. There are also new play modes, such as pre-season games, regular season games, playoffs, and sudden death. Quarter lengths have been adjusted in this version to be set at 5, 10, or 15 minutes. As in previous versions of the video game, there are no NFL or NFLPA licenses for authentic teams, player names, and stadia. Teams are organized by city name and colors.

MegaTech gave the game 95% and a Hyper Game Award, saying that "you'll enjoy it, even if you don't care much for the sport".[1] In October 1992, Mega placed the game at #1 in their Top Mega Drive Games of All Time.[2]</desc>

		<name>John Madden Football '93</name>
		<desc>John Madden Football '93 is a 1992 sports video game developed by Blue Sky Productions (later Looking Glass Studios) and Electronic Arts and published by EA Sports Network. Based on the sport of American football, the game puts the player in control of a football team in modes such as tournament play and sudden death. It was officially endorsed by John Madden.

The game's Sega Genesis version was developed by Blue Sky Productions, which was simultaneously creating Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss. John Madden Football '93 adds new animations and features, and it allows players to play as and against famous teams such as the Oakland Raiders of 1976. Aside from Madden Football 64, the game was the last in the Madden franchise to lack the NFL license, which was featured in Madden NFL '94 onward.

With over one million units in sales, John Madden Football '93 was a commercial success. Critics awarded the game high scores and praised its updated graphics; but several reviewers complained that little had changed since John Madden Football '92. Royalties from the game funded the expansion of Blue Sky Productions, and the company's director, Paul Neurath, later commented that the size of these royalties led Electronic Arts to develop future Madden titles in-house.</desc>

		<desc>This game can be played in two modes, either as Dr. Alan Grant or as a Velociraptor. Playing as each provides the user with an alternative story and level design. The climax of the game mirrored the unused climax of the film, in which Grant must defeat a pair of Velociraptors by causing the Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton in the Visitors Center to collapse on top of them. Grant himself is the final boss in the same location for the raptor storyline: your dinosaur character must cause the bone structure to collapse via specifically placed kicks to cause Grant to flee. A sequel was released using a new game engine and new artwork (with some of the original art as well), entitled Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition. In it, Grant's helicopter (that he just escaped on in the first game) crashes. Now he must deal not only with dinosaurs, but InGen as well. A new raptor must also make it off the island.</desc>

Unlike its predecessors, Kick Off 3 had no involvement from lead programmer Dino Dini, and thus plays very differently to other games in the series, having a "horizontal" pitch as opposed to a "vertical" one. Due to these radical changes, the game was met with controversy upon release. Dino Dini released his own football game around the same time for the Amiga titled Goal!, which made its way onto the Mega Drive as Dino Dini's Soccer.</desc>

The Japanese version, titled Shin Seikimatsu Kyūseishu Densetsu Hokuto no Ken (新世紀末救世主伝説 北斗の拳?, "New Legend of the End-of-Century Savior: Fist of the North Star"), is based on the manga series Hokuto no Ken (Fist of the North Star in English). Since the international version did not retain the Hokuto no Ken license, the graphics and characters' names were altered. It was the second Hokuto no Ken game released by Sega, following the Mark III original (released internationally as Black Belt). Versions for the Commodore 64 and Amiga based upon Last Battle were developed and released by Elite in Europe in 1991.</desc>

		<desc>Lethal Enforcers is out to clean up the streets in the baddest parts of Chicago. Digitized graphics and sound will slam you into cold reality and heated action. Your job is to defend the innocent and protect yourself from a fatal case of lead poisoning.
Your side iron is packed inside and ready to blow you away with a true arcade experience. Just like the arcade game, you've got the quick reload feature. Time it just right so you don't run out of ammo while you're trading bullets with the scum of the earth. Upgrade your firepower along the way to magnum, 12-round automatic, assault rifle, shot gun, machine gun or grenade gun.
Your type of street cleaning takes place where the dirtiest deeds go down. But first, a training level lets you take target practice and take out your frustrations, then on to reality. Be on the lookout for bank job in progress, high speed chase, ninjas downtown, hijacking at the international airport, gunrunners at the shipping dock, helicopter chase, chemical plant sabotage with volatile Heat of the Night Vision. The pressure under fire is so intense you'll be sweating bullets. Start shooting in any stage you select. At the end of each level, you'll get your hit percentage and your performance rank, from petrolman to commander.</desc>

The action is usually shown on a single screen with enemies "popping out" from various sections. If you do not shoot them in time they will either shoot or throw various weapons at you. You will lose energy if they hit you or you hit an innocent civilian.</desc>

		<name>Liberty or Death</name>
		<desc>The player can choose to control any of six Commanders-in-Chief, three each on the American Continental Army or British Army sides, during the American Revolutionary War.

For either side, the general objective is to eliminate all enemy troops throughout the Colonies by defeating them in battle. The strategies used to accomplish this change are based on which side you have chosen to play: the American side needs to hold out against the British and slowly gather its strength, while the British need to fortify their existing positions and quickly move against the Americans.

The gameplay focuses mainly on the military aspects of the conflict, but relationships with civilian, and particularly political, entities are of vital importance as their approval determines the budget for military spending, and in the worst-case scenario, they can vote for your ouster as C-in-C. Very historically accurate, the game faithfully reproduces the strategic situation of the war as well as many historical figures in great detail.</desc>

		<path>./Lightening Force - Quest for the Darkstar # SMD.SMD</path>
		<name>Lightening Force</name>
		<desc>The game format is mostly unchanged from the previous game (horizontally oriented and forward scrolling). However, many of the stages now stretch beyond the height of a TV screen, which allow the player more space to maneuver and dodge incoming fire (but also makes it easier to miss power-ups). Also, the player now has the option choosing the play order of the first four stages, instead of just the starting stage like in Thunder Force III.

The weapon system is similar to Thunder Force III. Featuring the same upgradeable defaults, and unique extra weapons that are either exclusive, or were in previous games. Again, upon ship destruction, the weapon currently being used is lost, apart from the defaults. The CRAWs return, and basically have exactly the same function as their Thunder Force III counterparts. The speed setting also returns, although it is represented by a percent gauge from 25 (lowest speed) to 100 (highest speed).

The most significant addition to the ship arsenal is the Thunder Sword, a very powerful lightning-based frontal attack. At the game's halfway point, the ship receives an add-on part which enables the use of the Thunder Sword. From here, the one requirement of using the Thunder Sword is that the ship be equipped with CRAWs. When the ship is not firing any weapons, a charging noise is heard (followed by a chime when fully charged) and the CRAWs will appear to be surrounded with electricity. The next press of the fire button will discharge the Thunder Sword. The blast is stronger if charged longer and is at its strongest when fully charged.</desc>

There are 13 different types of races, ranging from Motorways to night-time to sections punctuated by roadworks, and some are lap-based with others being simple A-B. 2 players could play on a split screen mode.

The game's crowning glory, however, was the RECS editor, which allowed you to create courses of your own, with theoretically millions possible.</desc>

		<name>John Madden Football '93</name>
		<desc>John Madden Football '93 is a 1992 sports video game developed by Blue Sky Productions (later Looking Glass Studios) and Electronic Arts and published by EA Sports Network. Based on the sport of American football, the game puts the player in control of a football team in modes such as tournament play and sudden death. It was officially endorsed by John Madden.

The game's Sega Genesis version was developed by Blue Sky Productions, which was simultaneously creating Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss. John Madden Football '93 adds new animations and features, and it allows players to play as and against famous teams such as the Oakland Raiders of 1976. Aside from Madden Football 64, the game was the last in the Madden franchise to lack the NFL license, which was featured in Madden NFL '94 onward.

With over one million units in sales, John Madden Football '93 was a commercial success. Critics awarded the game high scores and praised its updated graphics; but several reviewers complained that little had changed since John Madden Football '92. Royalties from the game funded the expansion of Blue Sky Productions, and the company's director, Paul Neurath, later commented that the size of these royalties led Electronic Arts to develop future Madden titles in-house.</desc>

		<name>Mario Andretti Racing</name>
		<desc>Mario Andretti Racing is a video game that was released in 1994 on the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. It was an early title in the newly created EA Sports line, and was developed by Stormfront Studios. The game was produced by famed sports game developer Scott Orr as part of his collaboration with Richard Hilleman in the creation of EA Sports. Race driver Mario Andretti personally guided the development of the AI used by the non-player drivers in stock cars, Indy style open wheel racing, and dirt track racing.

The game's greatest innovation was the presence of different physics and AI for three kinds of racing in one cartridge.

The success of Mario Andretti Racing led Orr and Hilleman to work with Stormfront to launch the highly successful NASCAR Racing series, which continues as one of the best-selling franchises in the EA Sports lineup today.

Another game starring Andretti, called Andretti Racing, was released for the Sega Saturn, PlayStation in 1996, and for PC in 1997.</desc>

This park is well-protected by the Fairies. Later, King Mole became rule of the under dwellers and sent his minions to take over Marvel Land, imprisoning the Fairies inside crystal balls.

A young lad named Talmit is called upon to rescue Wondra the princess, and free the Fairies from King Mole. Marvel Land consists of five worlds with seven stages each, and the game plays in platform style, in which you need to run through the level, killing enemies, and find the exit door. More often than not, you have to go through a bullseye to reach it. If you hit the bullseye at its center, you are awarded more points than you do by hitting it above or below.

You kill enemies by either jumping on their heads or attacking them with clones, which trail your movement unless you use them to attack enemies or collect food. The clones have a limited life and disappear one by one as you use them.</desc>

		<name>Mick &amp; Mack as the Global Gladiators</name>
		<desc>Global Gladiators (also known as Mick and Mack: Global Gladiators) is a 1992 platform game by Virgin Interactive, originally programmed by David Perry (who at the time had already moved to the United States and was located on the recently formed Virgin Games USA development studio) for the Mega Drive/Genesis and eventually ported by other Virgin Interactive teams in Europe (with the help of Graftgold and Krisalis Software) to the Sega Master System, Sega Game Gear and the Commodore Amiga. A Super Nintendo port was also in development but was never completed for undisclosed reasons, though a prototype exists on the Internet. The game is loosely based on the McDonald's fast food chain and has a strong environmentalist message.

A Game Boy port of the title was also fully developed (by Damian Stones, of Climax) but was never released for the same legal reasons as the Super Nintendo port.

In the single-player game, the player controls Mick or Mack through four worlds; Slime World, Mystical Forest, Toxi-town and Arctic World. Each world has several sub-stages where the character must collect a certain number of Golden Arches to advance.

They are guided in their quest by Ronald McDonald, who appears at the beginning and the end of the game. The characters are armed with a Super Soaker-type gun that shoots gooey projectiles.

The game engine is the same used in other Virgin Interactive games such as Cool Spot and Disney's Aladdin, as all of them (Mega Drive/Genesis versions) were handled by David Perry's programming team, which eventually turned into Shiny Entertainment.</desc>

Each of the four levels were based on amalgamations of the segments of Fantasia, each one around the elements: water (The Sorcerer's Apprentice, Dance of the Reed Flutes and Arabian Dance), earth (The Rite of Spring), air (Russian Dance, Pastoral Symphony and Dance of the Hours) and fire (Night on Bald Mountain, Toccata and Fugue in D Minor). The player defeats various enemies by jumping on them or by collecting magical bubbles that could be used to shoot at enemies as projectiles. In each level, the player collects a certain number of hidden magical notes in order for the song to play once again.</desc>

Each task is a different puzzle, given by a specific character. Daisy, for instance, will ask help to clean the castle's paintings hanging on a wall. The task is in fact a memory game, where Mickey or Minnie must clean the pictures matching pairs. After completing one task, they'll receive a gift.</desc>

Although it's still possible to create new characters, the game is also the first in the series to start the player off with a pre-generated party, lead by the noble Paladin Sir Caneghem (named after the head designer of the game). This is also the first game in the series outside of the Macintosh versions of the games to support playing using a mouse.</desc>

		<name>Monster World IV</name>
		<desc>Monster World IV (モンスターワールドIV Monsutā Wārudo Fō?) is an action-adventure platform game, developed by Westone and released exclusively in Japan by Sega for the Mega Drive in April 1994. It is the sixth and final game in the Wonder Boy/Monster World series.

The story involves a young girl named Asha, who upon hearing spirits whisper on the wind pleading for help, embarks on a journey to find and aid them. Along the way she becomes master of a genie and adopts a small monster known as Pepelogoo.

Monster World IV is a mix of action-adventure, platforming and RPG genres, in which the player traverses a 2D landscape fighting a variety of monsters as well as interacting with non-playable characters.

Expanding upon previous games in the series, Asha has the ability to swing her sword upward, downward, and across while in air, depending on which direction is pressed. She can also use her shield in a standing position by holding down.

Asha can summon her pet Pepelogoo to reach areas that she cannot on her own. By holding onto him, she can slow the descent of her jump (via his flying ability) or even perform a double-jump. Pepelogoo can also protect Asha from falling rocks, be used as a platform over lava geysers, and blow out fires that obstruct Asha's progress.

Equipment upgrades are purchased in the hub town. Armor increases Asha's pink life heart meter. Shields increase her defense and give her stat defenses to certain elements, such as fire or ice. Swords increase Asha's attack stats with critical effects depending upon the sword.

Some items cannot be purchased and must be found in the temples and caverns that Asha must explore. Healing medicine will restore Asha's health or bring her back to life if she has Pepelogoo. Gold bars can be traded with the rich lady in town for in-game currency. And finally, there are 150 life drops hidden throughout the game. Collecting ten will add a blue life heart to the life meter.

Items can be permanently missed. Once an area's boss is defeated, that area is inaccessible for the rest of the game.</desc>

		<name>Mortal Kombat 3</name>
		<desc>Fed up with continuous losses in tournament battle, Shao Kahn, who had lost to Liu Kang in the Outworld tournament, enacts a 10,000 year-old plan. He would have his Shadow Priests, led by Shang Tsung, revive his former Queen Sindel, who unexpectedly died at a young age. However, she wouldn't be revived in the Outworld. She would be resurrected in the Earthrealm. This would allow Shao Kahn to cross the boundary lines and reclaim his queen.
When Sindel is reincarnated in Earthrealm, Shao Kahn reaches across the dimensions to reclaim her. As a consequence of his action, the Earthrealm becomes a part of the Outworld, instantly stripping billions of their souls. Only a few are spared, as Raiden protects their souls. He tells them that Shao Kahn must be stopped, but he cannot interfere; due to his status, he has no power in Outworld, and Earthrealm is partially merged with Outworld.
Shao Kahn has unleashed extermination squads to roam throughout the Earthrealm and kill any survivors. Also, Raiden's protection only extends to the soul, not to the body, so his chosen warriors have to fight the extermination squads and repel Shao Kahn. Eventually with his final defeat, every human on Earthrealm comes back.
Mortal Kombat 3 follows Mortal Kombat II and shares continuity with both Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and Mortal Kombat Trilogy which were both updates of this game. The next new game in the series was Mortal Kombat 4.</desc>

Kahn agrees to this plan, and even restores Tsung's youth. He then extends the invitation to Raiden, who gathers his warriors and takes them into Outworld. The new tournament is much more dangerous, as Shao Kahn has the home field advantage, and an Outworld victory will allow him to subdue Earthrealm.</desc>

		<name>Mystical Fighter</name>
		<desc>Like in most games of the genre, the player (who controls a kabuki) can use combos, flips and swings to fight against tough opponents, fighting them in groups from three to five. Surprinsingly, boss fights are often easier than regular enemies. There is also a time limit, usually about forty seconds, for the player to finish the stage. If the time reaches zero before the player passes the stage, the player will automatically lose the game as it will be declared a defeat. Similar to Golden Axe, the player can use a special magic power, but instead of bottles the player must manually pick up scrolls. The more scrolls the player has, the stronger the magic attack will be; if the player chooses to use this attack, all the scrolls will be consumed.

There are also hidden bonus stages that can be accessed if the player approaches certain doors or rooms. These bonus stages contain magic scrolls, items to refill the character's health bar, or weapons. There are also traps and holes that both the player or the enemies can fall into. The traps and pits do not always hinder the player, and in fact can be beneficial if the player throws an enemy directly into the pit.</desc>

The Tournament Edition ups each team's roster to three players, and allows for substitutions between quarters. Shoving players now results in injuries, which lower a player's stats; encouraging you to sub them out and let them recover.

		<desc>Sega even had a third project running, this time for the Mega Drive. Once again, the development was done by a third party. This time it seems to have been the mostly unknown developer called Opus, as in-game art and the sound engine used indicate. This game was never released, probably due to quality issues, but a beta copy was leaked and can be played on emulators nowadays. The game would have tried to build on the concept of the original arcade game, but feels to some degree more like a very bad approach to the Streets of Rage school of beat-em-ups. It is obvious that it either was in a rather early development stage, or Sega did right to pull the plug on this botched mess.

The game features a lot of cut scenes, all of them in the finest Engrish. The chapter titles are in Japanese, though. The story doesn't make any sense, at least not in its presented state. Later in the game, you meet people you should know but don't, and about halfway through the game you get to know that your goal from the beginning was to rescue Ryu's kidnapped lady friend.</desc>

		<desc>Operation Europe: Path to Victory is a multiplatform war game where one or two players can compete in World War II action. The object of the game is to fulfill any one of the military objectives for either the Axis or the Allied forces. Players engage in modern warfare around Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Central Europe, and North Africa.

This game uses abstract numbers and figures in the map view and saves the concrete illustrations of soldiers only when they lock horns on the battlefield or in an urban setting. Urban settings give a traditional 1930s view of housing and office buildings that provide extra protection for units that are guarding them. However, there are massive numbers to crunch and the lack of graphics help enhance the number crunching ability of game's artificial intelligence.</desc>

		<name>Pac-Attack</name>
		<desc>On a Tetris-like board the player drops blocks consisting of Ghosts, Blocks, Pac-Men, and one Fairy (if your Fairy Meter is full) to the ground. The objective is to not let the blocks overflow, let Pac-Man eat the ghosts, and make lines to shorten the amount of blocks on the board. When Pac-Man eats a ghost, the Fairy Meter goes up. Once full, a fairy will eventually be dropped. Once the fairy comes to a stop by landing on anything, it waves its wand and every ghost in the eight lines below it will disappear, often resulting in numerous lines being completed and simplifying the board. Once the fairy disappears, the score bonus is given, and gameplay continues.

Pac-Attack can also be played in 2-player mode. Player 1 must eat Blinky, while Player 2 must eat Sue, the purple ghost from Pac-Mania. As players eat ghosts and complete lines, they will drop ghosts on their opponent's board, messing up their board and bringing them closer to the top. This game can even be played in puzzle mode. The object of this mode is to smash all 100 stages. If you get a Game Over, all the regular blocks appear with red crosses on them, while Blinky and Sue over backwards laughing silently. However, you can try the level again.</desc>

		<desc>After an introductory sequence in which Pac-Man introduces himself and the game's mechanics, the plot unfolds as a loosely connected series of misadventures stemming from Pac-Man's quest to complete tasks for his family, all while the ghosts and their mysterious leader plot to destroy him. Pac-Man is first tasked with finding milk for Pac-Baby, which he procures from the local farm. Some time after, Pac-Man is asked by Ms. Pac-Man to pick a special flower for Lucy, a friend of Pac-Jr's for her birthday. Pac-Man is given a trolley ticket which he uses to venture into the nearby mountains, hang-gliding and dodging ghosts and boulders as he searches for the flower. Upon returning home with the flower, Pac-Man is exasperated to find that Lucy's party has already started, and that she has already been given another flower. Some time after, Pac-Jr comes home crying, and tells his dad that his guitar was stolen by ghosts while he was in Pac-City. Pac-Man is given a train ticket to travel to the city, where he meets a man selling balloons, and takes on a disgruntled security guard to get the guitar back. In the final segment of the game, Pac-Man discovers from a news report that the ghosts are stealing ABC gum from children all over Pac-City, at which point the Ghost Witch of Netor takes over the broadcast and challenges Pac-Man to face her and her newly created Gum Monster. He sets off to work his way through the abandoned factory where the monster is being created. The game culminates in a final battle between Super Pac-Man and the Gum Monster. After the Gum Monster's defeat, the Ghost Witch and her minions flee, and Pac-Man is congratulated by the town and his family as a hero, except that he didn't save their ABC gum.</desc>

Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now in 3-D and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!</desc>

		<path>./PGA Tour 1996 # SMD.SMD</path>
		<name>PGA Tour 96</name>
		<desc>PGA Tour is a series of golf video games developed and published by Electronic Arts and later their EA Sports sub-label since 1990, the series primarily features courses featured on the U.S. PGA Tour, and other notable courses (such as those that have hosted majors).

In 1998, EA began publishing their golf games with the endorsement of Tiger Woods. After Tiger Woods 99 PGA Tour Golf was released, subsequent titles were named Tiger Woods PGA Tour and released yearly.

Although EA Sports developed most games in the series internally, some SKUs have come from outside developers including the first edition, Tiger Woods 99 PGA Tour Golf, which Adrenalin Entertainment developed in conjunction with EA for the PlayStation and Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2001 for the PlayStation, which was developed by Stormfront Studios. IOMO also produced versions of the game for mobile phones for the 2002, 2004, and 2005 editions.

In October 2013, EA announced that it would end its relationship with Woods, and be replaced by a new golfer on the next instalment. On March 16, 2015, it was announced that Rory McIlroy—the current top golfer in the world, would become the new title athlete of the franchise, which will now be known as Rory McIlroy PGA Tour.[1][2]

The series was responsible for several innovations in the genre, such as the now standard three-click swing method, and in 1995 a critic stated in GamePro that "The PGA series flies high above the rest for two reasons: You can completely control a shot, and you play on the best courses around."[3] However, unlike other games in the EA Sports label, the series was often shadowed by other competitors such as the Jack Nicklaus series, Links series, Microsoft Golf or The Golf Pro</desc>

		<desc>The time: Space Century 3240. The place: The Algol Star System. It began when King Lassic turned evil and let hordes of hideous, magical creatures run amok on the three planets. When her brother was killed, Alis vowed to avenge his death and put an end to Lassic forever.

Join her in a journey across time and space to worlds where creatures speak...where magic and science combine to take you on the ultimate video quest.

The battle system is turn-based, allowing the player to choose commands for up to four characters. Each of the eight characters has a different set of preferred weapons and armor, as well as techniques, suited to the character's job. The player must defeat enemies in the overworld and in dungeons to advance in the game.</desc>

		<name>Phantasy Star III: Generations of Doom</name>
		<desc>Phantasy Star III is a sequel to the previous game in the series, Phantasy Star II, although the connections to other games in the Phantasy Star series are not immediately evident. Gameplay is similar to the games before it in the series, with combat still being turn-based and battles randomly occurring. Players must explore both overworld maps and dungeons in order to progress through the game.

Phantasy Star III mostly follows the traditional roleplaying game formula seen throughout the series, with exploration of several 2-D worlds, character recruitment, and random enemy encounters using a turn-based battle system. Unlike previous games, the series staple of "techniques" play a diminished role in combat, which is ironic considering the role they play in differentiating the game's two major factions - with techniques being exclusive to Layans, and viewed as "evil magic" by the Orakians.</desc>

		<desc>Pirates! is a single-player game. The player receives a letter of marque authorizing service as a privateer for Spain, the Dutch Republic, England, or France in the Caribbean. The player's loyalties may change over the course of the game; he may also hold rank with multiple countries and may turn to piracy at any time. Gameplay is open-ended; the player may choose to attack enemy ships or towns, hunt pirates, seek buried treasure, rescue long-lost family members, or even avoid violence altogether and seek to increase his wealth through trade. The game also has no predetermined end, although as time goes on, it becomes more difficult to recruit crew members. Also, as the player character ages, fighting becomes more difficult, and deteriorating health will eventually force the character into retirement. The game ends when the player retires, at which point he is given a position in his future life, from beggar to King's adviser, based on accumulated wealth, land, rank, marital status, and other accomplishments.</desc>

		<name>Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure</name>
		<desc>Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure is a 1994 video game developed and published by Activision. A sequel to Activision's 1982 Pitfall! for the Atari 2600, the player controls Pitfall Harry, Jr., son of the protagonist of the original game, as he attempts to rescue his father from a Mayan jungle setting.

Activision developed the game in partnership with Redline Games. It was first released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Genesis/Mega Drive and Sega CD in 1994, followed by releases for the Sega 32X, Atari Jaguar, and PC the following year. The PC release was the first commercial release for the recently debuted Windows 95 operating system. Publisher Majesco Entertainment ported the game for the Game Boy Advance in 2001; a downloadable version appeared on the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console in 2009.

An extra feature in all versions is the ability to play the original Pitfall! (the Atari 2600 version) after finding a secret doorway within the game. The Sega CD, 32X and Windows ports contained extra (and expanded) levels and other enhancements over the other versions.

The Windows port was based on the Sega 32X version, and was made using Kinesoft's Exodus game technology, which was later used to make the Windows port of Earthworm Jim: Special Edition.[1] It includes 256-colour art, in-game CD music and effects by SOUNDELUX Media Labs. SoftKey version includes America Online free trial software for Windows 3.1/95, Internet Explorer 3.02, Cyber Patrol demo for Windows 3.1/95.

On April 13, 2009, the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive version of Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure was released on the Virtual Console in North America and later in the PAL regions on May 15, 2009 and in Japan on August 25, 2009. It was later delisted on December 26, 2013 in Japan and at the end of 2013 in North America and the PAL regions.</desc>

To win the map, the balance of power needs to be tipped completely to the player's side (represented by a scale below the mini-map), by conquering all (or at least most) of the towns on the map, and killing any opposing captains. Once a town is under the player's control, locals can be drafted into the player's army and bigger towns or enemy armies can be taken on. Some of the bigger towns also have neutral captains and if these survive the battle they come under the player's command as well.</desc>

Various ports were released for home consoles and personal computers. Efforts to perfectly emulate the arcade original have been unsuccessful due to an unusual copy protection method that the developers used.

Toys, comics, a novel (Primal Rage: The Avatars by John Vornholt), and other merchandise tie-ins were also produced</desc>

		<name>Prince of Persia</name>
		<desc>The Grand Vizier Jaffar has thrown you into a dark dungeon and plans to marry the girl of your dreams in an hour. You're not going to let that happen are you? Try to escape from the dungeon, take out Jaffar's guards, find your way through the Sultan's palace and defeat Jaffar himself. Now go, you've got 60 minutes!

Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer with run and jump gameplay. Your hero must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation of your character.</desc>

		<desc>While Donald is flipping through some books in Uncle Scrooge's library, a treasure map from King Garuzia, the old-time ruler of the Great Duck kingdom, falls out. It leads to the king's most prized possession. Donald thinks this is his path to riches. Unfortunately Big Bad Pete overhears and pursues Donald throughout the game hoping to steal the treasure.

Donald, using a partial map from the library, travels to a variety of places around the world seeking clues to find the treasure, including Duckburg and Mexico. After defeating Count Dracula in Transylvania, Donald receives a more complete map pointing to the Maharajah in India, Egypt, a haunted Viking ship, and finally the South Pole, where Donald finds an ancient Viking diary said to reveal the location of the treasure. However, upon finding the diary, Pete shows up, holding Donald's nephews hostage in exchange for the diary. After giving Pete the diary, Donald travels to Pete's hideout to defeat Pete and get the diary back. The diary reveals that the map, when dipped in water, will reveal the location of the Great Duck Treasure.

After evading the traps and defeating the ancient spirit guarding the treasure, Donald enters the treasure vault, only to find a simple stone statue. He is disappointed, but Huey, Dewey and Louie accidentally break the statue, which reveals a golden jeweled necklace was hidden inside. Donald gives the necklace to Daisy and the two fly off into the sunset together.</desc>

Radical Rex can use a skateboard or glide down hills, jump, kick and breath fire. Tougher enemies need multiple hits and when burnt Rex needs to kick them once more to destroy them or use his scream (hits everything on the screen). While playing Rex collects eggs, health, power-ups for his fire breath and scream refills. Checkpoints are shown as torches that need to be charged with fire. After each level, there is a Bomberman-like sequence to earn an extra continue. Enemies include flies, turtles, toads and all kinds of dinosaurs.</desc>

Besides finding the exit of the level, in some missions, prisoners must be freed or enemy ammunition supplies destroyed. Rambo is controlled from an overhead perspective and has several weapons at his disposal. Besides a machine gun that never runs out of ammo, he can use a knife for close range kills, set off timed bombs and use his famous longbow with explosive arrows. Ammunition for the bow and the bombs is limited and can be collected from dead enemies. Rambo himself, on the other hand, is vulnerable and can be killed after one hit.</desc>

Ranger X is equipped with a jet pack and an assortment of weapons. The jet pack allows for short periods of flight, the duration of which is limited by the jet pack's temperature. Upon overheating, the player must land and wait for cool down. Alongside Ranger X's standard pulse rifle, the player has access to various special weapons including a flamethrower and homing attacks. Unlike the pulse rifle, the special weapons drain a power bar, which can only be recharged when Ranger X is in a bright light source. This special arsenal can be increased by collecting power ups scattered across the levels. On certain levels, the player may also control a supporting vehicle - an Ex-Up, such as Indra - a futuristic motorcycle, a premise described as "RoboCop on a Harley".</desc>

Psygnosis cancelled ResQ very close to release for unknown reasons. It was reportedly programmed on 486 DOS PCs, with the artwork produced with Deluxe Paint II and III on Amiga 1200s. A prototype has since been unearthed, with an internal copyright date of 1993.

Notably, ResQ's bonus stages are depicted as third-person on-the-rails shooting segments which involve primitive 3D polyons, similar to the Super Nintendo's Star Fox.</desc>

These rings were then entrusted to representatives of each of the six classes (Sorcerer, Knight, Archer, Necromancer, Enchanter and Conjurer). All of the rings have been lost, and the story of the rings has turned to a legend. Master Thalmus has requested the presence of a young sorcerer named Buc, his most promising of students.

After defeating an ED-209 unit reprogrammed by the Terminators, RoboCop plugs himself into a console. Unknown to him, RoboCop gave Skynet information it can use. This ends up with RoboCop falling into a trap. In the future, RoboCop assembles himself, where he battled in the Terminator-infested future and destroyed Skynet.</desc>

		<desc>S.S. Lucifer: Man Overboard! is a platform game released for the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear in 1994. Originally developed by Zeppelin Games for the Commodore Amiga, it was ported to Sega's consoles by Odysseus Software and published by Codemasters. Non-Sega versions of the game are called Sink or Swim, and the working title for the Sega versions was simply Man Overboard!.

The game has you play as Kevin Codner, rescue mariner extraordinaire tasked with saving passengers from the S.S. Lucifer. Similar to Lemmings, this requires guiding the passengers to an exit by interacting with the environment. If the player takes too long the room will be flooded.

Neither the Mega Drive or Game Gear versions of S.S. Lucifer: Man Overboard! were released in North America or Japan. They remained exclusives for Europe and Australia.</desc>

It is the sequel to The First Samurai, a beat-em-up released for various home computers and the SNES internationally a few years prior.

You play as one of two Samurais (the 1-player mode has the male protagonist from The First Samurai only; the 2-player mode lets the second player control a new female Samurai). A and B both attack depending on what weapon you have equipped right now (only one at a time, some in limited quantities), what enemies/objects are nearby, and which D-pad buttons you are holding at the time. C jumps. A screen at the beginning of the game (also accessible from the Options menu) shows you what each in-game item does for you.

A Sega Mega-CD port was advertised, but never released.</desc>

		<name>Shining Force II</name>
		<desc>Shining Force II is a tactical role-playing game. The player assumes the role of the Shining Force leader, Bowie. When not in combat, the player can explore towns and other locales, talk with people, and set the members and equipment of the army. Some towns have a headquarters where the player can inspect and talk with his allies. While roaming through town or moving throughout the world, one can find both visible and hidden treasures and interact with certain objects.
Each ally unit is represented by a character with a background and personality. Some of these characters are hidden, requiring specific events to occur before they will join the force. Each ally unit also has a class, which defines the abilities for that unit. These abilities range from what type of weapons they can use to what kind of spells they can learn. Units can become stronger by fighting enemies and performing various actions which gives them experience points (EXP), which allow them to gain levels. Once a unit reaches level 20, that character has the ability to advance to more powerful class through promotion. Some characters have two different classes they may be promoted to, one of which is only accessible using a special hidden item.
Battles take place on a square grid, and each unit occupies a single square. Battle is turn-based. Each turn, a character can move and perform one action: either attack, cast a spell, or use an item. Some commands, such as equipping or dropping an item during the turn, do not count as actions.
The battle is won if all enemies are defeated, or if the enemy commander is defeated. If Bowie is defeated in combat or withdraws, the battle is lost and the player is returned to the nearest town, where he can recover his allies and fight the same battle again.</desc>

		<name>Shining in the Darkness</name>
		<desc>Shining in the Darkness is a "dungeon-crawler" RPG. The game puts the player in control of the main character as he and two friends (Pyra and Milo) explore 3-dimensionally rendered dungeon mazes.

The game consists of story line interaction, dungeon exploration, random monster fights, and predetermined 'boss' fights. The combat in this game operates similarly to certain RPG games of the same era (e.g. Dragon Quest). Monster encounters happen randomly during dungeon exploration at which point turn-based combat proceeds.
Additionally, the dungeon contains three characters in need of rescue. Rescuing any or all of the three is optional, and the story changes depending on whether or not the player locates and returns each of these characters to safety.</desc>

		<desc>Shove It! follows a burly warehouse worker, whose aspiration is to earn enough money to buy an expensive car and impress the ladies. What must this worker do? Move boxes.

The worker is placed in a special grid, and there are only a few different types of blocks: movable crates, locations for crates, and barriers. Crates can only be pushed, not pulled, and only one at a time. The object of each stage is to move each crate to one of the designates spots where crates must be placed. When this is complete, the worker progresses. There is a multitude of stages, grouped in clusters of ten apiece.</desc>

		<name>Sol-Deace</name>
		<desc>In the year 3300, human technology advances drastically when a super computer known as GCS-WT is created after an AI circuit is developed and utilized. GCS-WT's purpose was to ultimately unify every human society using the power of diplomacy, but GCS-WT has other plans: rather than unify mankind, GCS-WT turns societies into a dystopia after becoming an all-powerful dictator who controls all military action as it sees fit and oppresses mankind of various liberties; anyone who spoke against GCS-WT's will did not live very long.

Only one man was the most successful in running a campaign against GCS-WT: a scientist known as Edwin Feace. Feace had fled SOL completely and stationed himself near a recently discovered planet dubbed Cilius that awaited colonization. It was there that Feace secretly established a resistance group against GCS-WT and developed a multi-directional, dual-occupant space fighter called the Sol-Feace. The Sol-Feace was Edwin's plan to use against the GCS-WT and any who fell under its militaristic order in hopes of releasing human suppression. However, Edwin was assassinated along with thousands of colonists under GCS-WT's command before the ship could be mass-produced in a violent manhunt near the yet to be colonized planet Cilius.

Now, only the two crew members of the Sol-Feace – the pilot Eric Williams and his gunner Misao Hatanaka – stand in the way of GCS-WT's grasp over mankind.</desc>

		<desc>Crusader of Centy in the US, Soleil in Europe, Shin Souseiki Ragnacenty (新創世紀ラグナセンティ) in Japan, and Ragnacenty in Korea, is an adventure game developed by Nextech under contract from Sega in 1994 for the Sega Mega Drive. The game was translated to Korean (released 1995), English, French, German, and Spanish. The North American release was localized and published by Atlus. The game's music was composed by Motokazu Shinoda, a professional Japanese concert pianist and composer (sound programmer Noriyuki Iwadare is often miscredited as co-composer)

Soleil is a village in a large continent overrun by monsters, and the crusaders of Soleil are sent out by the King to save the humans. While on your own quest, you save an old lady who tells you to talk to a fortuneteller west of Soleil, who exchanges your ability to talk to humans with the ability to talk to animals (for the first half of the game, that is). Now, you must rely on your sword and the aid of a group of animals to rid the world of monsters — though along the way, you'll come to realize monsters aren't as evil as the humans make them out to be.</desc>

		<path>./Sonic and Knuckles # SMD.SMD</path>
		<name>Sonic &amp; Knuckles</name>
		<desc>The story picks up from the ending of Sonic 3 - Dr. Robotnik's orbital weapon, the Death Egg, has been badly damaged in the climactic battle between himself and Sonic The Hedgehog. As the satellite falls back to the Floating Island, landing in a volcanic crater, Sonic jumps off, landing in a mushroom filled woodland.
Sonic knows there are many Chaos Emeralds hidden on the island, including the powerful Super Emeralds and the Master Emerald, the secret to the island's levitation powers. Worried that Robotnik may try to harness this power to fuel a repaired Death Egg, he sets off to try and destroy the Death Egg once and for all, keeping an eye out for Knuckles the Echidna, still smarting from his Launch Base defeat.
At Hidden Palace, Sonic finds Knuckles there waiting for him. They fight and Sonic seems to emerge victorious when Knuckles flees from the duel after sensing someone is trying to steal the Master Emerald. Knuckles races ahead closely followed by Sonic to find Robotnik trying to steal the Master Emerald: It had been his plan all along to snatch it while Sonic and Knuckles were too busy dealing with each other. Realizing he had been tricked, Knuckles reacts by attacking Robotnik, which fails when Robotnik electrocutes Knuckles. Sonic tries to intervene but Robotnik stills manages to escape. Knuckles now realizes his mistake and that Sonic is in fact on his side. They join forces and teleport to Sky Sanctuary.
At Sky Sanctuary, Knuckles and Sonic watch the Death Egg launching in the background. Knuckles activates a bridge so Sonic can cross over. Sonic defeats a rebuilt Metal Sonic on the way to the Death Egg, and manages to board it before it leaves the atmosphere. Onboard the Death Egg, Sonic defeats Robotnik and destroys the ship once and for all, only for Robotnik to get away with the Master Emerald in one of his giant robots. If Sonic hasn't collected all seven Chaos Emeralds and/or Super Emeralds, the game ends here, and the ending in which the Master Emerald does not return to Angel Island occurs. After the credits, the player sees a scene with Robotnik still in possession of the Master Emerald.
If all the seven Chaos Emeralds and/or Super Emeralds are collected, Sonic transforms into Super Sonic or Hyper Sonic and chases Robotnik into the Doomsday Zone. After failing to lose him in an asteroid belt, Robotnik's machine is destroyed, Sonic and Tails return the Master Emerald, and the Floating Island becomes airborne once again. If the player didn't collect all the Super Emeralds, a scene occurs which shows an Egg Robo emerging from a pile of metal. If all Emeralds are collected, the player sees the Sonic 3 and Knuckles logo featuring Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles.</desc>

		<path>./Sonic and Knuckles - Knuckles in Sonic 2 # SMD.SMD</path>
		<name>Sonic &amp; Knuckles + Sonic the Hedgehog 2</name>
		<desc>Knuckles in Sonic 2 is the resulting game when Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is locked onto Sonic &amp; Knuckles with its passthrough port. Sonic is replaced by Knuckles and Tails is not playable whatsoever. The title screen features Knuckles also but removes the two player mode and options selections from it. This game is identical to Sonic 2 (aside from a few changes to make it more playable with Knuckles) but with Knuckles now playable instead of Sonic or Tails.

Sega, though adjusting Knuckles' physics to match those of Sonic &amp; Knuckles in-game, ran into issues with those same physics in the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 pre-game demos. A fix was created to keep Knuckles' jump height consistent with that of the jump height from Sonic &amp; Knuckles but also make the demos function properly. Knuckles' jump was modified so that it reached the same height as Sonic would reach in Sonic the Hedgehog 2, but his mid-air mobility was slowed to give the gimped feeling his jumps had in Sonic &amp; Knuckles. This fix corrected most of these issues; however, the mid-air speed cap caused Emerald Hill and Aquatic Ruin Zone's demos to be left in a sub par state.</desc>

		<desc>Sonic Crackers is an early prototype build of the game Knuckles' Chaotix, incorporating many of the elements that would appear in the final game. Its name comes from a peculiar, and clearly quickly made, ASCII-art title screen. Sonic Crackers is thought to be an engine test, composed of various different game engines, which are swapped out using RAM coding.

The game features Sonic and Tails, who, in the main demonstration of its link to Knuckles' Chaotix, are held together by rings that they carry and that are joined by an elastic force. Also, Sonic can pick up Tails and throw him upwards, to make it easier to reach higher platforms. The stages and music are also similar to those in Chaotix. There are no sound effects at all during gameplay. There are no badniks to be found, however there are spikes, and you lose rings when hitting them (even though you have none).</desc>

Because the service is now long defunct, the game was unknown to much of the Sonic community for a time. The game was later released in 2004 on Sega of Japan's website, and it received more widespread attention as it was noticed by English-speaking Sonic fans this time around.

The game was made available on Sega's B-Club download service in Japan. It nearly received a re-release, as evidence by the fact that data referring to it was found in Sonic Gems Collection.</desc>

Utilizing energy produced by the magma flowing under the volcano, this new monstrosity (the Veg-O-Fortress) has the power to transform helpless animals into robot slaves at an astounding rate. Sonic the Hedgehog and Tails fly onto the scene to mount an aerial assault, but Sonic is knocked off the wings of Tails' airplane by a blast from the fortress. He falls into the water, but is rescued and taken to the subterranean levels of the Veg-O-Fortress. The fortress must be destroyed from the inside-out, and the only way to make that happen is to trigger an eruption in the volcano it's built on. Sonic knows this can be done by removing the Chaos Emeralds that keep the volcano stable. Robotnik, however, is also aware of the fragile relationship that exists between the Emeralds and the mountain, and he's set up an elaborate Pinball Defense System to make sure the precious jewels don't go anywhere.</desc>

After completing each stage, the player controls each hero as they fight in similar-designed mini-levels themed after the "Behind-the-Scenes" of Murderworld. The only character to have a significant change is Storm, who now walks, shoots multiple bolts of lightning rapidly and calls upon gusts of wind, and jumps about four times the height of the other characters. The last level takes place inside a large room, where Arcade chases Spider-Man back and forth in a large Arcade-shaped robot, which operates like a Matryoshka Doll, until Arcade is finally defeated. The X-Men stand-by at the edges of the room, occasionally attacking on their own.</desc>

In 'adventure' levels, the player character moves around the Deep Space Nine, talking with NPCs and ultimately reaching a certain point in the plot. In 'action' levels, the player wanders the level in the cinematic platformer style, climbing ledges, fighting enemies with a phaser, finding and using items, with an ultimate goal to fulfill a certain mission, sometimes within a given time limit.</desc>

		<name>Star Trek: The Next Generation: Echoes From the Past</name>
		<desc>The game begins with the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D) in orbit around a red giant star near the edge of the Neutral Zone (the star adversely affects Romulan sensors, rendering the Enterprise undetectable). They are monitoring the border in response to increased Romulan activity; the Romulans recently lost contact with a vessel patrolling the Neutral Zone. Starfleet had agreed to assist in any investigation attempt as a sign of goodwill. The Romulans refuse the aid, and prefer to handle things on their own, which naturally prompts Starfleet to increase border patrols.

Immediately upon beginning play, the Enterprise receives a distress signal, broadcasting on all frequencies. It was sent out by one Dr. T'Laris, a Vulcan geologist stationed on a planet in the Codis Mu system (Codis Mu VI), and in the message she notes that her dig site was recently attacked by Romulans, and that the assailants are still present. The Enterprise responds to her plea for help and sets a course to her dig site.

As the game progresses, the player learns more about the missing Romulan vessel's mission, and of the IFD. The Enterprise also makes contact with an alien race known as the Chodak, hostile mollusk-like creatures who constantly accost the Enterprise as it traverses known space gathering clues about the IFD. There are also mentions of a now-extinct race called the Senatorious who were the last race to possess the IFD; the reason it resurfaced is because the Senatorious understood that they'd been using the IFD for their own benefit at the cost of all other races, and judiciously decided to send it ten thousand years into the future, in the hopes that civilizations then could put the IFD to use for the mutual benefit of all races. There is one more race, the gaunt Eunacians, which are encountered only once and, after the Enterprise repairs their ship, tell Jean-Luc Picard of the IFD Trials and the Eunacians' intention to participate. However, with their ship crippled, and the rest of their race residing in the Gamma Quadrant, they entrust the Federation with recovery of the IFD, and its judicious use.</desc>

		<desc>Street Racer is a racing game developed by Vivid Image and published by Ubisoft for numerous consoles and computers including the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Saturn. Similar to Super Mario Kart, the game allows the user to select one of many cartoon-like characters, racing around a circuit, avoiding obstacles and using special items.

Due to various hardware restrictions, gameplay differs among platforms - the Mega Drive version of the game has the player travel along a road in a similar manner to Hang On or OutRun, whereas the Saturn version renders its levels through 3D geometry, allowing the user to see more of the stage. The Japanese Saturn version of the game is called Street Racer Extra (ストリート　レーサー　エクストラ) due to these additions.

The Mega Drive version of the game was not released in Japan or North America, though did make it to Brazil and Europe. Plans for a North American version were put in place (even getting to the stage of having its own box art with ESRB rating), but were cancelled. Likewise the Saturn version of the game was not released in North America.</desc>

The leader of the syndicate has somehow managed to keep his identity a secret. The organization soon absorbed the city government (anyone can be had if the price is right). They even had the metropolitan police force in their back pocket. Looting, random violence and destruction are rampant. No one is safe walking the streets, day or night...
"As the chaos continued at full strength, three young police officers tried to establish a special attack unit. They were repeatedly turned down by their superiors, most of whom had been bought by the organization or were too afraid to make a stand. One day, when they could no longer stand by and watch their city being demolished, they quit the force!'
"Adam Hunter, Axel Stone and Blaze Fielding decided to forgo their careers in legal law enforcement and put their lives on the line. They are without weapons, but each possesses great hand-to-hand combat abilities. Take them into the heart of the city and battle the most dangerous wave of bad dudes and chicks ever assembled.

With the replacements in place, Mr. X plans to run the city using a remote control device.

Dr. Zan discovers what the research is really for and knows the Syndicate must be stopped. He contacts Blaze Fielding with the details of The Syndicate's plan. Blaze quickly contacts her old comrades Axel Stone and Adam Hunter for a task force to bring down The Syndicate once and for all. Axel quickly joins the task force, but Adam can't make it (due to his own assignments from within the police) and sends his young brother, Eddie "Skate" Hunter instead.

To celebrate the defeat of the mysterious "Mr. X" and his syndicate the previous year, Adam Hunter, Axel Stone, and Blaze Fielding met at their favorite nightspot in the city and spent their time reminiscing about their vigilante crusade against "Mr. X" and his organization. Axel and Blaze had moved out of the city after the adventure from last year. Axel has begun working as a part-time bodyguard and Blaze teaches dance classes. Adam has since rejoined the police force and lives in a small house with his younger brother.
The next morning, Axel received a phone call from Eddie 'Skate' Hunter, Adam's younger brother. Skate had arrived at home from school and was shocked to find his house in ruin and his older brother missing. Attached to the front door was a picture of Adam chained to a wall at the feet of Mr. X. The criminals began to retake the streets once more. Beatings and lootings took place regularly and in broad daylight. Chaos reigned in the city, far worse than before.
Realizing that "Mr. X" and his syndicate has returned for revenge against him, Blaze, and Adam, Axel wastes no time in telling Blaze about the unexpected situation and Blaze herself is determined to help Axel out in defeating "Mr. X" and rescuing Adam. Accompanied by Adam's young brother Skate and Axel's friend, a professional wrestler named Max Thunder, Axel and Blaze set forth on a rescue mission, which will take them from the city all the way to "Mr. X"'s hideout on a desolate island.</desc>

The player takes control Strider Hiryu, the youngest elite-class Strider in the organization. Hiryu is summoned by the organization's second-in-command, Vice Director Matic, to assassinate his friend Kain, who has been captured by hostile forces and has become a liability to the Striders. Instead of killing him, Hiryu decides to rescue Kain from his captors. With the help of his fellow Strider Sheena, Hiryu uncovers a conspiracy between a certain faction of the Strider organization led by Matic himself and an unknown organization known simply as the "Enterprise" (headed by a man named Faceas Clay) which involves the development of a mind-control weapon codenamed "Zain". In the course of finding and destroying these Zain units, Hiryu learns that the faction of conspirators is headed by Vice Director Matic himself. Hiryu eventually tracks Matic to an orbiting space station where the two Striders face off; after a brief battle Hiryu bests Matic and kills him. Afterwards Hiryu locates and destroys the last of the Zain units.

In the epilogue, it is revealed that though Hiryu was asked to return to the Strider organization he instead opted to retire. The final credits show him sheathing his weapon and walking away.</desc>

		<name>Super Baseball 2020</name>
		<desc>Different from real baseball and other baseball video games, this game consists of both male and female characters, as well as robots. All three types of players have the same basic abilities and vary only on their personal strengths. In many cases, human players are better than their robot counterparts. One major difference between the human and robot characters is that the robot characters can blow up (or lose all their power) if they are worked too hard during a game. That can happen if you constantly make them dive for a ball, run extra bases, or even if they get hit by a pitch. Under no stress whatsoever, some robots, especially pitchers, will naturally run out of power as the game progresses. When this happens, they will lose all their abilities and be useless, both offensively and defensively. When that occurs, you can either power them up or replace them with another person on the roster. Human players do not blow up, but human pitchers can tire out. When they are tired, they will pant heavily and throw the ball very slowly. This can be remedied by either an upgrade or, as in real baseball, switching to a relief pitcher.</desc>

		<name>Super Kick Off</name>
		<desc>Super Kick Off is a football game for the Sega Mega Drive, Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear, released exclusively in Europe and Brazil. It is considered by many to be the watered-down version of Kick Off 2, previously released for the Commodore Amiga (and ported to the Amstrad CPC, Atari ST and Commodore 64). Kick Off 2 was originally programmed by Dino Dini for Anco Games, with the console adaptions being handled by Tiertex.

From a franchise perspective, Super Kick Off would be followed by the controversial Kick Off 3: European Challenge. However, Dino Dini, who had no involvement in Kick Off 3 would go on to form his own company and produce the Amiga/IBM PC game Goal!, which shares similar gameplay. Goal! also arrived on the Mega Drive, in the updated form of Dino Dini's Soccer.</desc>

As part of the Air Force Special Operation Troop, you and Super Thunder Blade must take control of its state-of-the-art artillery to defeat the renegade guerrilla armies with plans to dominate the world. Luckily, Super Thunder Blade has the technology, but do you have what it takes? 

Re-militarized with an alloy body, this machine flies 523 km an hour and fires 4,800 shots a minute. This is an awesome amount of power at the flip of a hand, but reaching the guerrilla base is a challenge few are prepared to meet. You'll be attacked over land, over the sea and in the air by the likes of MIG fighter planes, nuclear subs and commando tanks. The only way to stay alive is to master the dogfight and unload your missiles accurately. 

The world's depending on you, so make this chopper dance.</desc>

		<name>Sword of Vermilion</name>
		<desc>Sword of Vermilion is about the son of Erik, king of Excalabria, who takes on a quest of revenge to defeat Tsarkon and free the world of Vermilion from evil.
In the town of Excalabria the people went about their business, and tended to the fields. One day, vicious fighting broke out everywhere as the army from Cartahena, led by the wizard-king Tsarkon, swarmed all over the town. The townsmen were overwhelmed, and the castle of King Erik V collapsed. Erik V summoned his bravest, strongest and most faithful warrior, Blade, and gave him his infant son and an ancient family heirloom, the Ring of Wisdom. Erik ordered Blade to save himself and the child while the castle burned. Blade traveled to a small village named Wyclif, where he settled down and raised the child as his own son. Eighteen years later, the son of Erik begins his quest.
The quest consists of travelling to towns and villages, battling creatures to gain experience and finding items such as swords, shields and armour, as well as many other items such as Herbs and Candles. Boss monsters take the form of larger, stronger creatures which are integral to the story. Fighting Boss Monsters takes place on a side on view of the battle where magic cannot be used.
The titular Sword of Vermilion is the most powerful weapon at the end of the game.</desc>

		<desc>Sixteen levels (in four groups of four) await you in this long-developed Bitmap Brothers title. The basic gameplay is similar to Gauntlet, but in an open air setting, with bridges across rivers and such in the maps. The visuals are in the 'metallic and blue' style the Bitmaps appeared to favor.

There were 6 characters available in the game, each with different strengths and weaknesses, and different starting prices. In 2-player mode you each chose a character and played co-operatively, but in one-player games you also choose a character for the computer to control, with its Artificial Intelligence allowing it to open doors, pick up power-ups and take on baddies away from the ones occupying your character.</desc>

The game features Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse trying to figure out why everyone in the circus has disappeared, and includes four different types of outfits and six different levels. While the SNES and Genesis/Mega Drive versions were practically identical, the GBA re-release in 2003 included some new features. As its predecessor, it received praise for its graphics and outfit system and was criticized for not being challenging enough and short. Notably, it was the first game with Minnie Mouse in a video game role.</desc>

		<desc>The Immortal is an isometric action-adventure game.

Your old mentor Mordamir has disappeared. Probably kidnapped. You're not too sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: 8 levels of isometric death await.

The Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards.</desc>

There is an exception during the level The Stampede, where Simba is running towards (or in the NES and Game Boy versions, running with the camera looking straight down on top of him) the camera dodging wildebeest and leaping over rocks.
In most versions of the game two bars appear on the HUD. To the left is the roar meter, which must be fully charged for Simba's roar to be effective. To the right is the health bar which decreases when Simba is hurt. At the bottom left of the screen is a counter showing how many lives Simba has remaining. Health can be restored by collecting bugs which come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Some rare health-damaging bugs also exist.
The player controls Simba (first as a cub, then later as an adult) in the main levels and either Timon or Pumbaa in the bonus levels.</desc>

		<name>The Lost Vikings</name>
		<desc>Three Vikings, Eric the Swift, Olaf the Stout and Baleog the Fierce, were kidnapped by the alien Tomator, the evil Croutonian ruler, who is collecting unique life forms to display in his gallery. The three Vikings will have to combine their unique skills to defeat Tomator, as well as a vast array of aliens, robots, giant snails, big lizards and more.

The Lost Vikings is a side-scrolling platform puzzle game with a twist. Instead of one character who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip switches and so on, there are three different characters, each with his own skills. Eric the Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout has a shield which can block attacks, function as an air glider or as a step to stand on. Baleog the Fierce can shoot things with his arrows (including switches) or kill things with his sword. The player has to use the three Vikings as a team if he wants to get past the increasingly difficult levels and puzzles.

The player controls one Viking at a time, but can switch between them at any point. The Vikings have limited space in their inventory which they can use to keep various items. Each Viking has three health points, and if he loses them all from confrontations with dangers, he dies (some threats kill instantly), and the level must be restarted.</desc>

		<desc>Bart vs. The Space Mutants is a platform game where the player goes into the role of Bart Simpson (from the TV show The Simpsons) and must stop the Space Mutants from invading Springfield.

On each of the five levels, Bart must collect (or get rid of) the ingredients that the Space Mutants are planning to use to build their machine, such as purple objects or balloons. He also has to collect enough "proof" of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob). This won't be easy since the Space Mutants are "using" human bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must use his X-ray Specs.

The ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, in the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, etc. Some even involve a little puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of the bar.</desc>

Both sorcerers died and the armlets were lost until now.

		<name>The Terminator</name>
		<desc>By the year 2029, man's war with machines is almost at an end. This grim holocaust was caused in the first place by the super defence mainframe Skynet, an artificially intelligent system which thought the easiest way to protect the planet was to wipe out the entire human race and replace them with robots. 

Thus a nuclear war was initiated which killed billions, and machines everywhere declared war on the survivors - even people's Megadrives and electric toothbrushes turned against them. Luckily for us humans the man John Connor was on hand to lead the human race to victory. In a last ditch attempt to ensure victory, Skynet decided to send a super-hard Terminator cyborg back in time to kill John's mother, Sarah, thus preventing the lad from ever being born! John got wind of this insidious plot, however, and sent one of his crack soldiers back to protect his mummy. 

In this long-awaited game of the film you play the part of Kyle Reese - hard person extraordinaire. It is your job to destroy that nasty Terminator and thereby save Sarah Connor from a sticky end. There are four levels of platform-based shoot 'em up thrills, each one loosely based on a scene from the movie - including the climactic showdown in an empty machine shop.

The outcome of the attacks result in the destruction of the Galaxy Federation affiliated planet of Reda, and heavy destruction on the planet Nepura (a.k.a.

Eventually, the Galaxy Federation learns that ORN houses Plealos deep below Nebula's surface when not in use and takes the opportunity to plan an operation to take it down. They send the next iteration of their Fire Leo series of fighter craft, the FIRE LEO-02 Exceliza, to destroy ORN bases on Nepura and eventually find and destroy Plealos. The player controls the Exceliza and travels through a variety of stages to accomplish this goal.</desc>

What made Thunder Force stand apart from the other shooters, the ability to switch weapons on the fly, hasn't changed a bit. However, the original mix of side-scrolling and top-view levels that was present in Thunder Force II has been dropped; only the side-scrolling levels remain.</desc>

		<name>Thunder Fox</name>
		<desc>In 199X, the world was lost in a vortex of terror. Malicious terrorism gripped the land, the sky, and the sea. There were two brave men who fought against this reign of violence. They were the anti-terrorism team, "THUNDER FOX."

Thunder Fox is an arcade game created by Taito. It was released in arcades in 1990 and for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis in 1991. It was later released on various consoles such as the Xbox and PlayStation 2 in a compilation of Taito classics. The title of the compilation is Taito Legends.</desc>

		<path>./Time Killers # SMD.SMD</path>
		<name>Time Killers</name>
		<desc>Time Killers plays much like Mortal Kombat, with some similarities to Street Fighter II. Rather than the standard layout of punches and kicks of various strengths, a specific button is used to attack with the corresponding body part: left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg, and the head. A stronger attack can be executed by pressing both limb buttons at the same time. The attack buttons involving respective arms and legs are also the basis of BloodStorm as well as Namco Bandai's Tekken series, the 2011 Mortal Kombat game, and Bio F.R.E.A.K.S..

If enough damage is done to an arm, it will be severed from the character's body, rendering it useless in combat. A character can lose both arms in the same round, forcing them to fight with only legs and head and depriving them of the ability to block. Damage can also be done to the legs, but they cannot be severed.

The player may attempt a "Death Move" by pressing all five buttons at once. If successful, the attack cuts off the opponent's head and ends the round immediately; however, it can be blocked. A "Super Death Move" is also possible, but can only be executed while near a stunned opponent; the player holds the joystick toward the opponent and presses all five buttons, cutting off both arms and the head. Both of these moves differ from the "Fatalities" in Mortal Kombat in that they may be attempted at any time, rather than after winning two out of three rounds. Severed limbs and heads are restored after each round.</desc>

		<desc>Yuko Ahso looks like an ordinary grammar school student, but she is actually the Valis Warrior.

"I defeated King Rogles of the Dark World with the Valis sword which was given to me by Queen Valia, but my friend Reiko died in the process" Yuko went home by train after that terrible fight. She didn’t have the slightest idea that she would be summoned to fight again.

"Yuko..." said a familiar voice. “Reiko," said Yuko, "is that you? But I thought you..." Reiko quickly admonished, “Go and see Queen Valia, Yuko. Emperor Megas has threatened Dream World and our friend Vecanti.

When Yuko was told of Vecanti’s great danger, a burning desire moved Yuko to action. She has risen to crush Megas’ ambition!</desc>

Against this common foe, Yuko Asou finds help in her new girlfriend, a Vecanti warrior-maiden named Cham, who was born in the Dark World and uses a deadly whip, and her own sister Valna Asou, who grew up within Vecanti and became strong in the ways of magic.

		<desc>In 2049, the human population of Earth embarks on a migratory voyage to try to colonize other planets. They leave mechanical "orbots" to clean up the mess they made on Earth through littering and pollution. Raster, a high-level orbot who watches Earth through a planetwide computer network, is accidentally attached to a working nuclear missile by a lesser orbot and goes insane, becoming an evil dictator named Warhead. He declares himself ruler of Earth, and begins preparing to execute any humans who dare return to their planet.

Enter Vectorman, a humble robot in charge of cleaning up toxic sludge by simply discharging it into the sun. As he lands on Earth after his last trip, he finds chaos and confusion. Because all the other Orbots are controlled by Warhead (Vectorman having not been affected because he was away), Vectorman takes it upon himself to destroy the errant orbot and restore peace to Earth.</desc>

		<name>Virtua Fighter 2 VS Tekken 2</name>
		<desc>Virtua Fighter 2 VS Tekken 2 is a pirated game based off Fighters Megamix and Tekken, made for the Mega Drive by an unknown company. Despite the name, this game includes 5 Virtua Fighter 2 characters, 5 Tekken characters and 2 Fighting Vipers characters: Akira, Pai, Wolf, Lion, Shun, Heihachi, Jun, Lee, Paul, Kazuya, Honey and Bahn. The control is poorly designed and the engine is similar to some other games like Tekken 3 Special. The player can only punch and kick, move slowly and jumpkick if the button is pressed at the perfect time. As a result, the game is more difficult than it should be, although in the options the health bars can be modified so that one or both of the players can't take any damage, making it impossible for the opponent to win.</desc>

It is set in a typical medieval fantasy setting and features traditional turn-based combat. The player controls several generals who can command up to eight different units ranging from ordinary soldiers and archers to more exotic creatures like mermen or lizards.The generals fight alongside their units, however they are much more powerful and are able to use more diverse commands than just moving and attacking, like recovering a small amount of HP or casting spells. Each unit has certain strengths and weaknesses; for example soldiers are good against archers but weak against cavalry etc. Combat is also influenced heavily by terrain types. When two units engage in combat a small animation, similar to those seen in Advance Wars or Fire Emblem, is shown.</desc>

		<path>./World Cup - USA 1994 # SMD.SMD</path>
		<name>World Cup USA '94</name>
		<desc>The game is viewed from a bird's eye-view perspective. Game time may be customised from as short as a minute per half to the full regular 45 minutes. A coin toss is determined by the 'home' team and play will commence. Depending on the options set before the match, the gamer may opt to have less dribble control (resulting in the game ball sliding in the direction of the player movement); manual goalkeeper control which puts the player in control of all goalkeeper saves and kicks; ball-trapping, of which the player will not be able to shield the ball and allows opponents to snatch it away without necessitating a tackle; and no pass-back rule which was implemented during World Cup '94 where a keeper may not pick up the ball whenever an outfield player passes it back to him.
If the gamer opts for manual goalkeeper control, the player would have to make a save by guessing where the opponent will place the ball and jumping into the general direction with any of the console buttons and the directional keys if applicable. Similarly, outfield players have the option to either pass the ball, kick it (when attempting to score a goal) or attempt a lob. Freekicks may also be executed using any of the above. However, a penalty kick is done in a different game screen similar to that of World Cup 98 (video game) and where a hovering indicator swings from side to side to indicate the direction of the shot.
Basic tactics (or preset tactics) can also be customised prior to the game and may be changed in-game. Team rosters, while not based on real-life players, have variable attributes amongst its players and divided into three major skills which are speed, dribble control and shooting accuracy. Goalkeepers do not have a separate skill evaluation method and can be picked from normal players.</desc>

		<name>World of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck</name>
		<desc>Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck are sucked into a magical world, while preparing for a magic act. Now they must survive over a dozen different side-scrolling levels, in order to return home.

Mickey and Donald can run, jump, or attack by flourishing their capes. Enemies defeated in this way turn into doves, cards, or other harmless objects depending on the enemy. After defeating the boss of each level, a new magic spell is learned, allowing the pair to traverse the next level; i.e. flying on a magic carpet or going underwater in an air bubble. This was one of the few Genesis games to feature voice samples.
The gameplay changes depending on if the player selects Mickey or Donald, in a one player mode, or if two people want to control both characters at once. For instance, Mickey can squeeze through certain gaps, while Donald must find a different route; if both are playing, Mickey can pull Donald through the gap. Either can stand on the others' shoulders to ascend higher, and lower a rope to pull the other up.</desc>

		<desc>Worms (ワームス) is a critically acclaimed turn based strategy game designed for the Commodore Amiga and ported to a variety of platforms including the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Saturn. It was the first in the series of Worms games, which continue to this day and still largely share the same gameplay as the original.

The game involves the player controlling a team of worms, each supplied with a variety of different weapons, and the aim is to eliminate all the enemy worms. Worms was revolutionary at the time due to the randomly generated and fully destructaile landscapes that the game employs, so an explosion will leave a huge crater and a different strategy may need to be divised.

As it is turn-based, the game allows up to 16 players to take control of units (though there is only ever a maximum of four teams).</desc>

The first part of the game has an organic feel to it, while the second part of the game features mechanical enemies. As there are some maze-like sections with dead-ends in the game, your spaceship scrolls backwards when you keep pressing the down key.</desc>

		<name>Zero Wing</name>
		<desc>Zero Wing is an horizontal shooter game where the player is in control of a ZIG, an escape pod released after its main ship was attacked and destroyed by the evil cyborg CATS, bent on taking over the world.

Like most games in the genre, there are three color-coded weapons: red (scatter), green (homing) and blue (lasers). Each weapon has three levels of power, and to obtain those, similar upgrades must be collected sequentially. However, what makes the game unique is the ability to use a traction beam to trap an enemy and then throw him against his peers, destroying them.

The game (more precisely, the European PAL version of it) is known for being the origin of the grammatically incorrect phrase in the English translation, All your base are belong to us, which has since become an internet phenomenon.</desc>

Star posts serve as checkpoints, where if the player was to lose a life then he or she would return to one.  When the player has collected at least 50 rings, star posts can be run past for an optional Special Stage.  At the end of the last act of each zone (with the exception of Sky Chase Zone which does not have a boss), Sonic confronts Dr. Robotnik.</desc>
